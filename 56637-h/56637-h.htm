<h3 class="p4">PREFACE.</h3>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">The</span> Authors, some time ago, read before different Societies
of professional men, Papers<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span>
 dealing with the Natural and
Artificial Purification of Sewage, and as these were favourably
received, the thought occurred to them that the time
might be opportune for making the information there given
available for a wider public.</p>

<p>As, however, a mere republication of the Papers would
have been against the rules of the Societies concerned, the
Authors decided to re-write entirely the subject matter, and
to bring it up to date, so that the present publication is
not a mere repetition of their old Papers clothed in a new
garb, but an entirely fresh publication, right up to date.</p>

<p>The Authors hope that they have given the information
in such a form as to be readily available for District Councillors,
Sanitarians, and all interested in this complicated
subject.</p>

<p>When considering natural and artificial sewage treatment,
it ought to be borne in mind that in the natural treatment we
<!--004.png-->
have to deal with one treatment only, and that, in order to
bring the results obtained from artificial processes up to the
same standard, the artificial treatment ought to be supplemented
by a treatment for the removal of nitrates from
the effluent, and another for the removal of pathogenic
micro-organisms, which means one treatment in natural, as
against three separate treatments in artificial purification.</p>

<p>In addition to this it must be understood that, owing to
the great losses by evaporation and by growing plants, which
are continually at work on sewage farms, especially during
the summer months, when, as a rule, the flow of water in
the brook that takes the effluent is smallest, the quantity of
the effluent from the natural treatment is probably only from
one-half to one-third that resulting from the artificial treatment,
which is a point of very great importance.</p>

<p>If it can be proved to them that Nature is not sure and
true enough in its methods, the Authors are prepared to
assist it with methods and means produced by the inventive
brain of man. But if such proof is not forthcoming, they
adhere&mdash;in preference to groping in the dark&mdash;to Nature’s
own methods, knowing from experience, that when allowed
full scope and fair treatment, it is most sure in all its ways.
That will not prevent them, however, from giving in the
future, as they have done in the past, the question of sewage
treatment in all its aspects their most careful consideration.</p>

<div class="p2 sidenote">Introductory remarks.</div>
<p>"How extremely simple it all is!” was the remark of a
recent visitor at a sewage farm&mdash;which encourages me
to venture on publication of the most recent discussions
on a “problem” complicated by engineers, chemists, bacteriologists
and inventors of systems, who have raised
clouds of dust through which it is difficult for ratepayers
and district councillors to find their way to “the best
practical and available means of sewage disposal.”</p>

<p>I have a belief that publication of all attempts to
purify <em>the whole</em> of a town’s sewage, rather than small
scale experiments with equations founded on such data,
is the desideratum.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1872.</div>
<p>Having begun in the year 1872, with a pamphlet,
“Will a Sewage Farm Pay?”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span>
 I desire to proceed with
the present one thirty years later, as my humble contribution
to a right understanding of the intelligent
Scavenger’s business.</p>

<p>At the earlier date agriculture was prosperous, and
ratepayers of Exeter were just as confident that sewage
farming would bring large dividends as some of the same
<!--010.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 2]</span>
city’s councillors are at present not in the least sceptical
that their engineer’s septic system is the true specific for
sewage disposal.</p>

<p>In adhering to land as the natural and best agent, I
have had the support of the Local Government Board
with that of many Royal Commissions, notably the one
now sitting, and I have naturally chosen cases where
suitable land was accessible when I desired to demonstrate
the efficiency and simplicity with which the powers
of Nature can be applied for the use and convenience of
man.</p>

<p>Nor have I failed to study all “artificial” substitutes
for the best means, wherever difficulties of obtaining
suitable land presented themselves, e.g. my Canvey Island
scheme for dealing with the sewage of London on a
relatively small area, and other cases.</p>

<p>Of late years I have welcomed the light thrown on
this subject by bacteriologists, but lamented extravagant
statements put forward by those who fail to see that the
previously unrecognised microbes can do their work, as
they have always done it, to most advantage in the upper
layers of any porous land.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1902.</div>
<p>An interim report by Lord Iddesleigh’s Royal Commission
has, however, awakened such theorists to the fact
that land is not to be discarded because it may not bring
in a profit or because patentees of systems find it to their
interest to contrast neglected or badly managed sewage
farms with carefully nursed little experimental installations
for artificial treatment of selected samples of
sewage.</p>

<p>Recognising the marvellous improvements in arts and
manufactures of all kinds due to steam, chemistry and
electricity, the public has naturally expected similar
results from applied science in artificial sewage treatment,
<!--011.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 3]</span>
and there has been no lack of study of every imaginable
process during the last thirty years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1884. Lord Bramwell’s Royal Commission establishes principles.</div>
<p>But the late Lord Bramwell’s Royal Commission
on Metropolitan Sewage Discharge established two very
important points of general application, namely:&mdash;&#8203;</p>

<p>1. The principle of separation in works of sewerage
and drainage; and</p>

<p>2. The fact that the suspended matters in town
sewage can be very effectually removed from its liquid
by <em>simple deposition</em> without the aid of any chemical
reagent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1887. The chemist Dibdin discards chemical reagents in favour of M. Pasteur’s aerobic organisms.</div>
<p><a name="dibdin" id="dibdin"></a>And Mr. Dibdin three years later began to demonstrate
the mistaken policy of adding lime or any other
precipitating agent in any quantity likely to arrest the
natural agency of abundant bacterial life, which ultimately
disposes of all dead and effete organic matter by
forming gases or natural compounds, with more or less
offence to human senses, according to the supply of
oxygen and rate at which these bacteria can carry out
their work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Leeds and Exeter.</div>
<p>It was soon found that the bacteria of two classes,
aerobe and anaerobe, abound in sewage, and the latest
Leeds experiment with the continuous or trickling filter
show the marvellous rapidity with which the <em>aerobic</em>
microbes at any rate, can accomplish their task where air
and liquid sewage are sufficiently diffused in the pores of
a filter; while Mr. Cameron, C.E., at Exeter has shown
rapid evolution of gases and considerable solution of
organic solids by <em>anaerobic</em> microbes in a septic tank.</p>

<p>But the enthusiasm of inventors and their converts
has made too much of the benefit to the human race
supposed to be conferred by the bacterial discovery of
M. Pasteur as applied by them to sewage treatment.</p>

<p>Without detracting from the credit due to the great
<!--012.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 4]</span>
French savant and other bacteriologists who have followed
up his interesting studies of ferments for the last fifteen
years, the practical man may well ask how much forwarder
have we got in the main and pressing business of purifying
our rivers&mdash;as a consequence of clearer knowledge of
minute forms of life?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intermittent filtration.</div>
<p>The late civil engineer Bailey-Denton demonstrated,
thirty years ago at Merthyr Tydvil, the best conditions
of intermittent downward filtration, and his filters there
and at Kendal, Abingdon, etc., are still doing their work
efficiently to this day, while the coke, coal, clinker, burnt
ballast, etc., beds, so popular of late, are clogging up after
a few years of more careful treatment than was ever
accorded to an acre of land under sewage.</p>

<p>Anaerobic action has also been proceeding in the old
sewers of most towns and, as it has now been proved
that there is no advantage in the exclusion of air, upon
which Mr. Cameron laid so much stress when he brought
his Exeter tank to public notice in 1897, there can be no
novelty except its name attaching to the anaerobic or
<em>septic</em> system, which has thrown many sanitary authorities
off their balance of late years.</p>

<p>The whole modern system of self-cleansing sewers
having been only rendered possible by public recognition
of the horrible nuisance arising from middens, cesspools,
and irregularly built sewers of deposit, it is hard for those
concerned in the cleanly disposal of sewage to be told
that because sewage works are usually remote from
populous districts they must there put up with the cesspool
nuisance and fancy its old smell changed by the new
name, because a preliminary stage in the transmutation
of sewage has not taken place, as was formerly the case
in the sewerage system of some modern towns, before
arrival at the works.</p>

<p><!--013.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 5]</span>
But in this as in other affairs there is force in the
old maxim, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Medio tutissimus ibis</cite>, and a properly constructed
open tank, for simple deposition of the solids
(frequently washed out), arrests most of the solids and
allows fresh liquid sewage, after slight anaerobic action,
to pass on to land or filter bed in a perfectly inoffensive
condition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The cleanly and dirty processes for sludge removal.</div>
<p><a name="cleanly" id="cleanly"></a>As an example of this I have, at Aldershot, a pair of
tanks close to a public high road, one of which fills with
sludge and is emptied every fortnight or so, and as a
contrast there is another pair of larger tanks in a remote
quarter of the same farm in use for years as septic
tanks, from which some sludge is drawn off at long
intervals, anaerobic action being allowed its full course
as in the Exeter experiments.</p>

<p>It is interesting to compare the results of these
preliminary clean, and dirty, processes respectively on
similar <em>very fresh</em> domestic sewage which enters the clean
depositing, and the septic tanks alike, and my observations
are as follows:—</p>

<p>1. The manurial result in growth of crop <em>slightly</em>
greater with the septic liquid.</p>

<p>2. Labour increased by the greater deposit carried
on to the land under septic liquid.</p>

<p>3. The removal of sludge and washing out the clean
tank gives an hour’s work with very little smell ten
yards to leeward of the site, but drawing off sludge from
the septic tank is a very unpleasant operation, and, at
all times, the vicinity of tank and carriers is malodorous
for a radius of at least fifty yards from the septic tanks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Loam on sand and gravel the best medium for aerobic organisms to work in.</div>
<p><a name="best" id="best"></a>Passing now to the aerobic stage of sewage purification
we find it universally admitted, that a good loam
resting on very porous sand or gravel, affords the best
medium for work by the oxygen-loving nitrifying organisms
<!--014.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 6]</span>
when they are supplied with constantly moving
liquid sewage, and given intermittent periods for the
aeration of the pores of the soil.</p>

<p>The proportion of sewage to land is of course as
variable as the quality of the land itself, and the best
sort of land is rarely available, while the improvement
of natural land is not understood by the engineer or
chemist, who are usually appealed to by sanitary authorities
in their sewage difficulties.</p>

<p>Hence the variety of artificial substitutes of contact
beds, costing from 5000<abbr title="pounds" class="pounds">l.</abbr> to 12,000<abbr title="pounds" class="pounds">l.</abbr> per acre, which
have been proposed of late years, with the object of
purifying a large volume of sewage on a small area.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Leeds experiments.</div>
<p>Mr. Dibdin first startled the world with the formula
1,000,000 gallons per acre, but that has long been cut
down to 200,000 gallons, and the life of the contact bed
has become the subject of serious concern, as shown in
the annexed table of experiment at Leeds.</p>

<p>Others have sought to increase the proportion of
sewage to area by arranging for <em>continuous</em> instead of
<em>intermittent</em> application; but the difficulty of sprinkling
so that every part of a bed may be kept just moist, in
order that aeration may be continuous as well as the
dropping sewage, is very great, and increases with every
gallon and foot from the scale of a laboratory experiment
to that of a practical working for a town’s sewage.</p>

<p>There was an article published a few years ago in
the Journal Royal Agricultural Society (England) on
“The Making of the Land,” showing how nearly all the
value of agricultural land in England has been stored up in
it by the exertions of our forefathers, through a process
of successive improvements from, in many cases, worthless
sand and clay, to a condition of the greatest fertility;
and I often think that the 12,000<abbr title="pounds" class="pounds">l.</abbr> spent at Birmingham
or elsewhere on an acre of contact bed could be expended
to better purpose in preparing 100 acres of the
worst land to deal, for any number of years, with as
much sewage as the contact bed may do for a few years.
In the one case we know no limit to the life of the
purifier, and that it must be a very short one in the
other case.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wrexham sewage farm.</div>
<p><!--016.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 8]</span>
<a name="wrexham" id="wrexham"></a>At Wrexham, in North Wales, I had nineteen years’
management of about 150 acres of good land, with a
mixed residential and manufacturing sewage of some
15,000 population, with large breweries and leather
works. The owner of this land at the termination of
lease asked so exorbitant a price for the improved
freehold, that the corporation decided to sacrifice the
sewage works on his land, and to carry out a scheme of
mine for carrying the outfall sewer two miles further to
a site of 200 acres, which they could acquire on reasonable
terms in the year 1889.</p>

<p>During my management there was no trouble about
the effluent, although it was carefully watched by the
authorities of the city of Chester, which takes its water
supply from the river Dee, some twelve miles below my
late farm; and the fact that the scheme which took the
Wrexham sewage two miles nearer to the Chester waterworks
intake was carried out <em>unopposed</em> is, I think,
strong evidence of well-founded confidence in the efficiency
of land treatment where the public have the
opportunity of observing such results. It is easy to get
up a case with expert evidence against any sewage
scheme where the land-owners, clergy and others have
no means of properly informing themselves, and have a
prejudice against sewage which it is very difficult to
overcome except by giving the utmost possible publicity
to the truth.</p>

<div class="sidenote"> The Camp Farm, Aldershot.</div>
<p><!--017.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 9]</span>
<a name="camp" id="camp"></a>Of late years, while working for the War Department,
I have found it expedient to be more reticent, but the
Camp Farm restoration has in one way or another become
known to the public, and there can be no great harm in
my now referring to the circumstances as neither martial
law nor a censorship has yet been proclaimed in Hampshire.</p>

<p>When Aldershot Camp was first hutted, soon after
the Crimean War, a certain Colonel Ewart, R.E., had
imbibed true ideas of the separate system through his
association with the work of the late Mr. Menzies, the
Deputy Ranger of Windsor Forest, who preached and
practised that system in the drainage of Windsor Castle
and the town of Eton at a time when every other civil
engineer scouted the possibility of keeping rain or
subsoil water out of foul sewers&mdash;they said it was
essential for flushing their big sewers.</p>

<p>Colonel Ewart, at any rate, impressed his corps, and
after about 1866 one began to see the word FOUL
painted up over gratings into which the soldiers were to
pour their slops. A civilian, James Blackburn, also a
friend of Menzies, was employed by the War Office to
deal with the camp sewage on about 100 acres of rough
heather-covered land close by, and he, knowing his
business, watched what came down the sewers in wet
weather and kept the Royal Engineers up to the
Menzies standard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Blackburn’s successful management.</div>
<p>Together with this initial advantage of having a
regular volume of sewage not much affected by storm
water to deal with, Mr. Blackburn had many drawbacks
in the “pan,” as it is usually called, of iron conglomerate
underlying the very irregular surface which was pitted
all over with holes from which gravel or sand had been
dug many years ago; but he persevered until he had
<!--018.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 10]</span>
got nearly all the area to bear good crops, when he
entered the Camp Farm in competition for the Royal
Agricultural Society’s 100<abbr title="pounds" class="pounds">l.</abbr> prize in 1879 for the best
managed sewage farm in the United Kingdom. The
Report of the Judges at that competition is recorded in
the Society’s Proceedings 1880, giving full statistics
except financial accounts, which Mr. Blackburn withheld
because he was then in treaty with the War Office for
new terms after fourteen years’ work on the War Department
Farm. My impression after reading the judges’
reports and having seen the farm a year or two previously
to its date, is that, if the condition as to the production
of the financial accounts could have been fulfilled, the
first prize would have been awarded to the Camp
Farm instead of jointly to those of Bedford and to
Wrexham.</p>

<p>Mr. Blackburn had built a big wooden shed and
sublet it to a man who bought his ryegrass for some
fifty cows (for whose milk there was a great demand in
the camp), so this subtenant made a tempting offer to the
War Office and got a fourteen years’ lease of the whole
farm, while Blackburn retired in disgust.</p>

<p>I wish to write only from knowledge of facts, and will
therefore take up my narrative again in 1895, after an
interval of some fifteen years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Neglected state of, in 1895.</div>
<p>In the month of May 1895, I was called upon to
visit the Camp Farm and report to Mr. Henry Campbell-Bannerman,
the Secretary of State for War at that
date.</p>

<p>I found the whole farm in a deplorable condition of
neglected nuisance, stagnant lakes of sewage retained
here and there by banks of earth, buildings and fences
in decay, and the greater part of the camp sewage
passing, by pipes laid by its tenant, under a road which
<!--019.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 11]</span>
forms the lower boundary of War Department land, to
some rough meadows held by their tenant from civilian
owners for the purpose of saving him the trouble of
spreading the sewage over the sloping surface of the
War Department Farm&mdash;work which required the use of
a land surveyor’s level and staff.</p>

<p>In the ditches of these flat meadows the sewage could
go through the septic process to its fullest extent as the
level of the river Blackwater kept them nearly full at all
times, and the supernatant liquid could spread over the
coarse herbage of these meadows only in winter floods,
with the result of heavy crops of hay, and sewage disposal
conveniently out of sight and outside War Office
jurisdiction when a Royal Engineer officer might come
to inspect the Camp Farm from time to time.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><cite>British Medical Journal’s</cite> report.</div>
<p>But before my visit an active Medical Officer of
Health (Dr. Seaton), taking an interest in the state of
the river bounding his county of Surrey, detected the
camp origin of the stagnant sewage, and, concluding that
the meadows must form part of the Camp Farm over the
road, made a serious report about “Government Sewage
Marshes,” which the <cite>British Medical Journal</cite> took as a
text for an article, and the Thames Conservancy
attacked the War Department as soon as their 1894 Act
gave them jurisdiction in the matter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Temporary abatement of nuisance.</div>
<p>I was told that the Camp Farm milk and grass had
been condemned, and that the tenant had consequently
sold his cows and was to give up the farm on June 20,
1895; therefore my report was wanted <em>forthwith</em>, but it
was only to take account of anything which could be
done <em>temporarily</em> to abate nuisance, as an agreement was
pending with the Aldershot District Council for the
removal of the camp sewage outfall to some site, at least
two miles distant from the camp, at which the District
<!--020.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 12]</span>
Council was to become solely responsible for its future
disposal, together with their own Aldershot town sewage,
and the War Department to be rated for the purpose
like any other householder.</p>

<p>I found the Commanding Royal Engineer then in
office fully alive to the existing nuisance and prepared to
support any efforts I might make to abate it. Accordingly
I agreed to become manager in control of such
labour and material as was necessary for immediate
temporary improvement, and being supplied with army
horses, and any necessary buildings, tanks, etc. to be
constructed by the Royal Engineers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1897. The War Office resolve on permanent improvement.</div>
<p>After about two years it became understood that the
nuisance could be permanently remedied on the Camp
Farm, as I had said from the first, and accordingly the
draft agreement, which had then been in discussion for
five years, was abandoned. I was asked to prepare a
scheme and estimate for such permanent works as would
enable the sewage to be effectually disposed of on the
Camp Farm.</p>

<p>Recollecting that the sewage had to be at once cut
off from Dr. Seaton’s “Sewage Marsh,” and its disposal
provided for throughout on War Department land, it
will be observed that the improvement work had to
proceed piecemeal with some extra care and arrangement;
but on the whole I am satisfied that the work has been
completed with greater efficiency and economy than
would have been the case if the sewage had been turned
into the river and the whole site handed over to a
contractor for two years in the usual course.</p>

<p>About the same date (end of 1897) about 13 acres of
land was handed over to my management with sewage
from the Royal Military and Staff Colleges at Sandhurst,
about 8 miles distant from the Camp Farm, and, being
<!--021.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 13]</span>
somewhat better land to begin with, this part now
presents a very pretty example of what a small installation
for about 1000 population may accomplish.</p>

<p>But it is worked as part and parcel of the Camp Farm,
horses being sent out to Sandhurst from Monday to
Saturday when required.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, worthy of note that the reform of the
Camp Farm was initiated in 1895 by the Secretary of
State for War in a Liberal Ministry, and that it has
weathered for seven years all the storms of Jingoism and
the fashionable crazes for artificial sewage treatment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Buller’s period of command at Aldershot.</div>
<p>But whatever may be the rights or wrongs of General
Sir Redvers Buller’s quarrel with the Press and the
Government, his reputation as a practical agriculturist is
undeniable, and while in command at Aldershot it was
his custom to stroll over the Camp Farm on a Sunday
afternoon, occasionally leaving a message with cowman
or bailiff to warn me of anything he found amiss, for
which I was very grateful, living as I do ten miles away.
I am proud, therefore, to be able to publish the following
letter from one who has shown that he is not to be influenced
by complaisance to superior or inferior in expressing
or modifying his opinions, and he writes as follows:—&#8203;</p>

<p><span class="sc">My dear Jones</span>,</p>

<p>I am delighted to hear that you are publishing a book
about sewage treatment.</p>

<p>The sewage farms at Aldershot and the Royal Military
College afford ample proof of what a sensible practical man
can do. But it is not every one who knows what those farms
were before you took charge of them, nor do I think that any
one seeing them now could conceive their previous condition.
It is to that I can testify; you have turned putrid sewage bogs
into fertile fields. You will confer an immense benefit on the
<!--022.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 14]</span>
country if, by your book, you can only teach sanitary authorities
generally that the crux of the whole question is the necessity
for practical commonsense measures against sewage stagnation,
and if those measures are taken nature will do the work of
purification without the assistance of expensive patents or
artificial devices.</p>

<p class="p2">It must not be gathered from the foregoing account
that the War Office authorities are prejudiced in favour
of the <em>natural</em> treatment of sewage, for, like many other
sanitary authorities, they have been bewildered of late
years by the numerous forms of “<em>artificial</em>” treatment in
vogue, and I know of more than one experimental
installation for barracks where good available land has
been neglected, for I read last summer of ghastly failures
among the bacterial arrangements in some of those.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Success mainly due to activity of farm bailiff, foremen and other workers.</div>
<p>I cannot quit the above account of the vicissitudes of
the Camp Farm in fourteen years’ growth from a sandy
waste to a condition which tempted a tenant to pay a
rent of 3<abbr title="pounds" class="pounds">l.</abbr> odd per acre in 1880&mdash;its retrogression to its
primitive waste during the following fifteen years&mdash;and
restoration to its present measure of fertility, without
expressing the belief that Mr. Blackburn’s success and
my own have been mainly due to our good fortune in
obtaining the willing services of excellent intelligent
foremen and workers who, one and all, have taken a real
interest in their several tasks.</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron and other engineers may boast of their
labour saving (?) automatic appliances for opening and
shutting valves on sewage works, but practical workers,
responsible for dealing with a million gallons a day and
<!--023.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 15]</span>
upwards average, in hourly varying flow of town sewage,
will agree with me in hesitation as to placing entire confidence
in the substitution of automatic machines for any
large proportion of their manual labour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Education and encouragement of sewage employees advocated.</div>
<p>I have for many years advocated education of sewage
farm managers and watermen, to be selected from the
rapidly decreasing class of agricultural labourers by the
tender of high wages, houses and good gardens, with
other profit-sharing allowances which it will well pay
sanitary authorities to hold out to their sewage
employees.</p>

<p>In this sense I am glad to note the recent formation
of “<cite>The Association of Managers of Sewage Disposal
Works</cite>,” Secretary, Charles H. Ball, 5 Fetter Lane,
London, E.C., as a Trades Union move from within well
calculated to raise the status of the class of men upon
whose exertions the community must mainly rely if there
is to be any hope of improving the condition of our
streams and rivers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evidence and Reports of Lord Iddesleigh’s Royal Commission.</div>
<p><a name="evidence" id="evidence"></a>Two large Blue Books containing the evidence taken
by Lord Iddesleigh’s Royal Commission have been
published since the Interim Report, and their contents
more than warrant the opinion expressed in the latter;
indeed it must surely be admitted that the case for each
of the artificial systems was very fully gone into before
that Commission expressed the guarded conclusion, “We
doubt if any land is entirely useless.”</p>

<p>I do not believe that the surface purification obtained
by distribution over even the densest of clay lands was
<em>effectively</em> put in evidence, and too much weight was given
to the difficulty of increasing the effective top soil on
such land; but on the whole I think that the Interim
Report is very satisfactory to the reasonable advocates of
a preference being given to the adoption of a large area
<!--024.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 16]</span>
of land, where available, over any artificial treatment on
a small area, other things being equal.</p>

<p>At the time when the Interim Report was issued,
however, a very full and careful examination of a select
number of sewage farms was still in progress, and
Appendix 22, with a casual mention by Dr. M’Gowan,
affords the only glimpse to be had in the bulky Blue
Books, of any results of that examination having been as
yet adduced in evidence.</p>

<p>The Commission’s officers, to my knowledge, were
engaged for many months in examining, surveying and
taking numerous samples of sewage and effluent at the
Camp Farm, and, as they doubtless had equal opportunities
of independent observations on the other selected
sewage farms, the further reports of Lord Iddesleigh’s
Royal Commission cannot fail to be interesting and
instructive.</p>

<p>On one point Appendix 22 to the Blue Book
abundantly supports an opinion I have so often expressed,
namely, that a good strong loamy surface is a more
efficient purifier of sewage than many feet of barren sand.</p>

<p>I refer to the curves in Appendix 22, showing the
greatly superior purification effected at Nottingham
with the best soil as compared to that of the sandy one
at Aldershot, which, in its natural character, is about the
worst for purification and for producing crops to be
found in England.</p>

<p>My experience, however, all points to the extreme
importance of studying local conditions from the first
inception of plans in each particular case, to their completion
with the best available materials.</p>

<p>But when the engineer has done his best, the sanitary
authorities, having borrowed the funds to pay for the
work, will take no further trouble about its sewage, and
<!--025.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 17]</span>
will often engage careless ignorant workpeople at
inadequate wages to carry on the hourly varying labour,
on efficient performance of which success depends.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Automatic appliances for sewage and effluent discharge.</div>
<p><a name="appliances" id="appliances"></a>It may seem idle to complain of boards and their
employees showing little interest in the work of sewage
disposal, but it is worse to pander to their failings by
selling them automatic machines under the pretence that
all the thought, and fertility of resource, required for
efficient sanitary sewage disposal can be supplied by
ingenious applications of hydraulics on the principle that
sewage is a fluid, and, as such, will behave like clean
water.</p>

<p>Of course, when the aerobic treatment is carried out
on a bare level surface of cinders or coke growing only
weeds, the lack of interest is very excusable, but in the
natural system the growth of crops and contouring a
sloping surface with carriers so that every part shall have
its trickling water alternating with dry periods for cutting
the crops or hoeing out weeds, should be a matter of
constant interest to an agricultural worker, and, if he
knows his business, good crops and purity of effluent
must go together.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Managers should have a free hand.</div>
<p>In order to attain this happy result, a manager must
know his business and be given a free hand, not pestered
by members of a committee (farmers, butchers, gardeners
or town tradesmen) coming to give their advice or
orders. The river authority should take samples as often
as they like and send the manager as soon as possible
the analyses with day and hour of sampling as a guide
for future working.</p>

<p>He will then have to explain any defect from average
purity of effluent, due to one of the hundred contingencies
which may arise in practice, after he and the
river authorities have agreed about what that average
<!--026.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 18]</span>
analysis should be for his particular farm or works; and
it will be for the advantage of all parties not to try
and enforce a fixed standard for a whole district, as
some river authorities usually attempt to do, because it
is easier to lead than to drive a good manager, and
nothing at all can be done with a bad one.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that I think river authorities
should be easy going, quite the contrary, but they should
trust their inspectors’ reports, and “run in” those sanitary
authorities who are careless about the management of
their sewage farms and trying to cut down working
expenses and capital.</p>

<p>In precipitation or other artificial sewage works it is
easy to judge this, but more difficult for any one except
the good farm manager to know whether the land is
being made the most of for profit or for purification;
still the rivers authority ought to get to know if they
and their officers take pains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Purification and profit.</div>
<p>It is a common idea that working a sewage farm for
profit, and for purification of the sewage, are two incompatible
things, whereas, the good manager with sufficient
working capital (double or more what would be enough
for the same acreage in ordinary agriculture) and a good
market for produce will attain the two together in due
proportion in all ordinary seasons, when a fair allowance
has been made him for the necessary sanitary work.</p>

<p>It is easy to see how the popular idea of incompatibility
has arisen in a case like that above stated of
the Camp Farm tenant, eating up year by year all the
fertility stored up in the land during the previous period,
and letting nearly all the sewage run to waste, because
its scientific application would cost much in thought and
labour. In much the same way district councils have
been, all over the country, stinting their labour bills and
<!--027.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 19]</span>
interfering with their managers’ purchases and sales in
order to make as small a demand on the rates as they
can&mdash;each year bringing some change of system&mdash;to the
end that nobody is responsible or has any confidence in
master or man.</p>

<p>With such a state of things up and down the country
the way was prepared for preachers of microbe agency
to say, why should you buy all that land when a septic
tank, a few acres of coke or burnt ballast, and a patent
automatic opener and shutter of valves (which you see
working so nicely with tap water and model at some
exhibition) will give you “no more troublesome sludge,”
and a first class effluent with hardly any labour bill? if
you only agitate against that arbitrary Local Government
Board, which insists upon land!</p>

<p>But those gentlemen neglected the fact, that in a
few years’ time their filters would have to be pulled to
pieces, washed and put back, while the land remains
as efficient as ever, and a valuable asset, in some cases
saleable at building value, if it becomes desirable to
move the outfall further at some future time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sludge treatment.</div>
<p><a name="sludge" id="sludge"></a>In the above comparison between natural and artificial
treatment reference has been had chiefly to the
aerobic branch of the business, but the anaerobic, breaking
down <em>some</em> of the solid organic matter and the
sanitary disposal of the remainder in the state of sewage
sludge (containing fully 90 per cent. of moisture) must
not be overlooked or shirked as beneath the attention of
the scientific bacteriologists and chemists whose analyses
of effluents, and often of what they call crude sewage,
are made from the liquid which has passed through a
filter paper in their laboratory before their “oxygen
absorbed” or “ammonia processes” are proceeded with.</p>

<p>On the contrary, I have always maintained that
<!--028.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 20]</span>
sludge, being the foulest part of town sewage, ought to
receive primary and earnest attention if we desire to
improve the condition of our watercourses.</p>

<p>When town sewage is pumped through a long rising
main, it can often be spread on the land in its really
crude state, and if the soil is clay ploughed up to receive
it the sludge is most beneficial to its texture.</p>

<p>But in every other case we must face the nuisance of
extracting the sludge, and its desiccation in one of the
following ways.</p>

<p>1. On a farm at some distance from roads and
houses, the cheapest plan is to form a bank of earth
about 18 inches high, enclosing a rectangular area into
which the wet sludge can be run or pumped out of
depositing tanks, and left alone until dry enough for
cartage, when it can be used on the farm or sold to
neighbouring farmers for a shilling or two a load.</p>

<p>2. A wall of farmyard <em>long</em> manure may be used
instead of earth, and trench 5 feet wide dug on each side
of the longer sides of the rectangle, leaving 3 feet of
ground between the wall and trench, on which men can
stand to scoop the sludge over the wall when it has
consolidated a little in the trench; the latter is then
ready to receive the sludge from another tank emptying,
which is again scooped over the wall on to a thin coating
of farmyard manure, which has been scattered over
the last layer of sludge in the rectangle; and thus in a
year’s time a solid mass of the mixture is raised four or
five feet high, and is in capital order for putting in drills
for a crop of mangold wurtzel.</p>

<p>This is the plan in use at the Camp Farm; it occupies
little ground and smells only like rotten dung does
during the few days carting to the mangold field.</p>

<p>3. Pressing by compressed air forcing a liquid mixture
<!--029.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 21]</span>
of sludge and lime into the interstices between cloths
supported by vertical iron plates on a horizontal frame;
and such pressing is a very expensive process, only
resorted to when the sewage works are in a confined
populated district where no accumulation of sludge can
be tolerated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Expert examination of neighbourhood a very necessary preliminary to any sewage scheme.</div>
<p>Before any sewage scheme is conceived a very careful
survey of the neighbourhood ought to be made by a
person who knows the requisites of a site for sewage
disposal, especially if land irrigation is intended, because
natural advantages of site both for tanks, main carriers,
roads, etc., may make all the difference in the world in
expense and efficiency not only in first cost of works
but also in their use afterwards.</p>

<p>And if land is to be acquired for sewage farming it
will be very desirable to include in the purchase some
neighbouring high lying area, not required for sewage
disposal but for growing straw crops to be used on the
farm.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc"><a name="cropping" id="cropping"></a>Cropping a Sewage Farm.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Vegetation of some kind, useful or weeds, <em>will</em> grow from sewage, and must be frequently removed from land or contact bed.</div>
<p>This is a matter of vital importance, because when
sewage is <em>intermittently</em> applied to land of any kind or to
coke beds, vegetation of some kind or other must result
and must be removed in order to leave a clear course
for the next dose of sewage; the cost of removal and
destruction of weeds will be found very great when
contact beds are tried on any working scale and would
be quite prohibitive if allowed to grow on irrigated
land.</p>

<p>Hence we must crowd out the weeds as much as
possible by useful plants which will bring something
towards the cost of their removal; and as that return
from perishable greenstuff is dependent upon its
<!--030.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 22]</span>
immediate sale or consumption on the farm, the
manager must cast about for demands for his
abundant supply; but as both the sunshine (in this
climate) and markets are very capricious factors in
the problem, he has no easy task always to make both
ends meet.</p>

<p>Theoretically the town which yields the sewage ought
to provide an abundant demand, but in practice it can
rarely be depended upon, Edinburgh being the only
exception, where the Craigentinny sewage meadows are
rented at a very high figure by the cow-keepers of a city
situated in the heart of an arable district.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alternative destinations for vegetation thus removed. Milk (everywhere in demand) or a destructor furnace.</div>
<p>Fortunately, however, there is always an unlimited
demand for milk, and if he has the means of keeping
a herd of cows on the farm, or can arrange with a
neighbouring cow-keeper to take all the grass and roots
he can supply at a low rate, it is about the best course a
manager can adopt.</p>

<p>If he maintains a herd of cows, tied up in good, well
ventilated stables, and has them daily brushed and
groomed like horses, they require no exercise and
produce milk in perfection for an average period of
fifteen months from date of purchase after their third or
fourth calving.</p>

<p>Such a herd will consume rye-grass carted from the
field from April to November, and mangolds, kohl-rabi,
and rye-grass hay during the winter, thus securing a
uniform demand for produce of the sewage land throughout
the year, and such cows will only require a little
cotton cake and oat straw bedding (of which latter they
eat a good deal) to fit them for sale to the butcher as
soon as they become dry.</p>

<p>The advantage of such a steady demand is so great
when rye-grass and mangolds, etc., are indicated as the
<!--031.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 23]</span>
main crops of the farm, owing to the large volume of
sewage per acre, that the system of cow-keeping is forced
upon managers, however reluctant their sanitary authorities
may be to provide the necessary working capital,
unless they can find a reliable contractor to receive at a
fixed price any quantity of grass and roots the authority
may grow and deliver.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Permanent pasture grazed and for hay available in certain cases.</div>
<p>When a town has more land in proportion to its
sewage, permanent pasture may take the place of Italian
rye-grass, and, with proper precautions, a part of the
permanent pasture may be grazed; but the saving of
labour, thus supposed to result from letting animals bite
and carry their food, is expended in making up, in a
necessarily imperfect manner, the carriers trodden in by
the cattle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance of neat tidy contour carriers, correctly levelled.</div>
<p><a name="contour" id="contour"></a>And here I would observe that most of the bad odour
into which sewage farming has fallen of late years is
distinctly traceable to the common absence of sufficient
regularly contoured and neatly cut distribution carriers
resulting from parsimony about wages bills natural to
the ratepayers’ representatives in Council, and often to
the manager’s dependence on a borough surveyor’s
coming to the farm with his level and staff for great
measures, or on his own guesses for smaller works,
instead of using an instrument to peg out every distribution
carrier at the right moment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attract good labour.</div>
<p>There is another important outlay of capital to be
provided for in every complete sewage scheme, which
should embrace sufficient good labourers’ houses and
gardens in order to attract and retain on the spot the best
class of workers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary of the experience of a lifetime.</div>
<p><a name="summary" id="summary"></a>To sum up the general conclusions to which my
experience points, and which I trust may prove useful to
district councillors, they are as follows:&mdash;&#8203;</p>

<p class="blockquote"><!--032.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 24]</span>

1. In works of sewerage, limit and regulate, as
far as possible, the volume of sewage by excluding
subsoil water and clean surface water.</p>

<p class="blockquote">2. Where the outfall sewage enters the disposal
works provide a pair of open catch-pits (or grit-chambers),
each twice as wide as, and 2 feet deeper
than the sewer, with sluices allowing the sewage to
pass through one pit at a time in its free course,
while the other pit is being dried and the deposited
detritus dug out. The depth below sewer invert
may be more than 2 feet, and length of catch-pit is
immaterial, but I confine its width to twice that of
the sewer in order to conserve sufficient velocity in
the current to carry forward organic matter, paper,
etc., and leave only clean sand and gravel in these
catch-pits.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Continuing the course by open channel (of same
width as outfall sewer), it should expand to five or
six times its width, forming the screening chamber,
and thence discharge into the</p>

<p class="blockquote">3. Depositing tanks. These are best formed in
concrete with smooth surface, with a semicircular
level weir from which the liquid overflows into a
semicircular collecting open carrier leading to the
aerobic process on land or contact bed.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The semicircles above referred to are struck from
centre of the inlet to depositing tank with a radius
of 50 feet or more.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The weir level should be at least 1 inch below
that of invert of inlet, and the depth of tank
immediately under this point should be governed by
consideration of the facility of drawing off the sludge
by valve at that depth to the sludge drying beds by
gravitation if possible, or pump if necessary, and
<!--033.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 25]</span>
from this sludge emptying valve the smooth concrete
bottom of tank slopes up to the semicircular weir
above described.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The bottom and sides of such a tank should be
made with the best Portland cement and finest
granite chippings wrought to a smooth surface, so
that the sludge may be easily swept clean away with
a squeegee to its outlet valve, as it is very necessary
to have the tank thoroughly washed after each
emptying if my view of the <em>clean</em> mode of sewage
disposal is to be carried out.</p>

<p class="blockquote">But with the dirty mode, on the contrary, some
of the sludge only should be drawn off and the
septic anaerobic action preserved continuously in the
tank itself, whereas I prefer that action to have its
early and less offensive course in the tank and its
completion in a drying bed mixed if possible with
farm-yard manure.</p>

<p class="blockquote">4. The aerobic process. The one essential point
in this final process, whether in land or “contact
beds,” is <em>sufficient</em> aeration (excess as by blowing
has no result commensurate with cost of its introduction),
and it can be attained by intermittence of
sewage and rest, or by continuous passage of sewage
through a bed of coarse medium <em>kept always just
moist in all its atoms</em> by a rain-like dropping on
the surface so carefully adjusted as to moisten all
parts and not to form a water-seal in any part of the
bed. Intermittence is easily arranged on any scale of
working, and continuous filtration, on the contrary,
is difficult even for a few thousand gallons a day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Anticipation of a coming reaction against “fads” and overpressure in sanitation.</div>
<p><a name="fads" id="fads"></a>Since the above was written our grand old
philosopher Herbert Spencer has published a volume of
<!--034.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 26]</span>
“Facts and Comments”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_3" id="fnanchor_3"></a><a href="#footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span>
 containing a chapter on
“Sanitation in Theory and Practice,” which points to a
coming reaction against the movement begun, some fifty
years ago, by the late Sir Edwin Chadwick and followed
up by many enthusiastic exploiters of the popular dread
of “germs,” which he associated with bad smells.</p>

<p>Of course the professor’s practical acquaintance with
Chadwick’s hobby is, as he says, very limited, and his
argument, that because sewage and manure smells are
harmless in the open air of the country, they should be
equally innocuous in a town, falls to the ground when
brought to the test of experience, and I trust that
Mr. Spencer will forgive me for pointing out that sewer-gas,
drawn into a dwelling room, in town or country,
through scullery waste pipe or other connection with a
sewer in which the air is of lower temperature than that
of the dwelling room, is really prejudicial to health
whether accompanied or not by disease germs.</p>

<p>And although, as one of the experts to whom
Chadwick appealed and whose moderate testimony was
cast aside because it did not come up to the standard
desired by his enthusiasm, I fully endorse Mr. Spencer’s
caution with regard to the mass of Blue Book evidence
on sanitation, I venture to express my regret that the
dear old man has had an unfortunate experience of
sewage treatment, and my surprise that so deep a
reasoner should have published his judgment in this
chapter without having taken the pains to extend his
acquaintance with sewage treatment in other places than
the single instance of Burton-on-Trent.</p>

<p>In thus despising an unsavoury subject Mr. Spencer

take advantage of the prejudice and ignorance of their
employers.</p>

follows in justification of the reflection with which I began
the above essay:&mdash;&#8203;</p>

<p class="blockquote">"New sanitary appliances are continually being
devised, sanctioned by authority, and required by
surveyors; and surveyors may have and certainly sometimes
do have, personal interests in pushing the use of
them; either as being shareholders in the companies they
are manufactured by or as receiving percentages on the
numbers sold through their recommendation.”</p>

<h3 class="p4"><abbr title="One">I.</abbr> INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.</h3>

<p class="p2">At the request of <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel A. S. Jones, <abbr title="Victoria Cross">V.C.</abbr>,
<abbr title="Associate Member Institution of Civil Engineering">Assoc. M. Inst. C.E.</abbr>, who has done yeoman service in
this matter, I have great pleasure in putting down some
observations on this old but ever controversial question
of sewage treatment.</p>

<p>Colonel Jones has done more than anyone else living
to establish correct views on sewage farming, and he has
lately changed the Government sewage marshes at Aldershot
into a veritable “Garden of Eden,” watered by the
waters from Aldershot Camp, growing healthy crops, and
causing not the slightest nuisance. After many struggles,
even the milk from the dairy cows is now recognised as
good and supplied to the military hospitals. This is an
achievement of which anyone might be proud; and all
those who have been over the farm during the time of
the “deluge,” and can now study the order and system
evolved out of chaos by Colonel Jones will testify to this!
It is pleasant to record that the War Office have recognised
Colonel Jones’ work for them by having appointed
<!--037.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 29]</span>
him quite recently to manage all the sewage disposal
works in the Aldershot district. This will involve the
laying out of irrigation works in eight separate places,
in some of which artificial methods of sewage purification
have been tried and found wanting.</p>

<p>Before commencing with my task proper it may not
be out of place to describe here very shortly the various
stages through which the sewage question has passed
during the century just closed. Such a retrospect is of
general interest and may throw some further light upon
our subject; it must of necessity be short, otherwise it
would absorb more time and space than is at my disposal,
and any shortcomings in this respect that the reader
may discover, I trust he will kindly put down to this cause.</p>

<p>"The man in the street” seems year after year more
called upon to form an important element in settling
questions even of a scientific nature, and if what I am
going to say should prove of some service to him my
labours will be well repaid.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="p4"><a name="retro" id="retro"></a><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> THE SEWAGE QUESTION DURING THE
LAST CENTURY.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">A Short Retrospect.</span></p>

<p class="p2">In dealing with the sewage question during the last
century, it will be an advantage to distinguish between
the theory and practice of sewage purification,
as such a division of the subject will render it less complicated
and will tend to avoid misconceptions.</p>

<p>Dealing first with the theoretical side of the question,
it is very doubtful whether at the dawn of the century
even a working hypothesis existed to explain the process
<!--038.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 30]</span>
of sewage irrigation which was then adopted in one or
two instances, notably at Edinburgh, where the town
sewage was very successfully purified on the Craigentinny
meadows. It is more than likely, that at this time
instinct took the place of theory, and that sewage irrigation
was an instinctive imitation of irrigation with river
water employed for many centuries in some eastern
countries.</p>

<p>Later on it is on record, that Cagniard de la Tour in
France, about the year 1825, and Schwann in Germany,
about the year 1836, expressed the view, that organised
substances&mdash;micro-organisms&mdash;played some role in fermentative
and putrefactive changes. Almost diametrically
opposed to this were the views authoritatively laid down
by the then star in the chemical horizon, Justus von
Liebig, who, about the year 1845, maintained that these
changes were brought about by the dead inert matter
itself&mdash;by molecular movements in the same&mdash;and not by
organised substances, the presence of which in fermenting
or putrefying substances was purely accidental. So great
was Liebig’s authority then, that many almost blindly
adopted his views, and the strife that commenced around
these opposing views was fought with the greatest bitterness.
But the stronghold of old ideas, which were
gradually but surely being supplanted by new ones,
could not hold out for ever against combined attacks, however
stoutly it was defended by its designer, and its final
downfall came about the year 1860, when a young
Frenchman, Pasteur, established beyond doubt by his ever
classical researches, that fermentation and putrefaction
were, in the first instance, due to living organisms and
not to dead matter. Pasteur further demonstrated that
living organisms were also the cause of some and probably
of all zymotic diseases.</p>

<p><!--039.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 31]</span>
So far, so good! But unfortunately the methods of
biological research employed by M. Pasteur were very
cumbersome and left otherwise much to be desired, so
that his discoveries could not be fully utilised and
extended, until in 1882 Robert Koch of Berlin published
his new methods of investigation. This was the signal
of raising the floodgates of biological (bacteriological)
research throughout the world with this result, that the
flood waters pent up until then inundated practically
other branches of scientific investigation and drowned
their individual life for some time to come.</p>

<p>During this interval, 1860 to 1882, investigators who
wished to study the organised impurities in sewage had
to proceed by indirect methods. They had no means of
ascertaining by direct biological experiment the number
and character of the micro-organisms contained in sewage:
all they could do, was to determine chemically the dangerous
nature of the sewage by the amount and origin
of organic matter it contained, which would probably act
as food to the germs; and the greater this amount was,
so it was inferred, the greater would be the number of
germs it harboured and the more dangerous its character.</p>

<p>This was the condition of things at the time the
second Rivers Pollution Commission carried out its investigations,
which in many respects, and rightly too, are
still considered standard investigations. It cannot be surprising,
therefore, that, being without proper means of
biological examination, and having to rely chiefly on
chemical methods only, the Commissioners came to the
conclusion that the changes brought about in sewage
purification were due to mechanical and chemical
agencies!</p>

<p>It is frequently a matter of the utmost difficulty to
<!--040.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 32]</span>
ascribe, after the lapse of half-a-century, a new theory
to one special author, as several investigators may have
been trending the same way quite independently of each
other, but may not have been equally successful in the
matter of their publications becoming generally known.
Theories, as a rule, do not drop out of the clouds like
meteorites, they force themselves gradually upon men’s
minds and are elaborated by them until ripe.</p>

<p>Bearing this in mind, and subject to further research,
it would appear as if Alexander Müller had been the
first to apply Pasteur’s general theories as to decomposition,
fermentation and putrefaction to the problem of the
self-purification of sewage. He made his experiments in
1869 and published them in 1873. Since that date a
very large number of investigators have been at work on
similar lines, and whilst it would lead too far to deal with
them minutely, it ought to be stated that the results of
their labour confirmed the view of living organisms
playing a very important part in the decomposition of
sewage. Among the many names prominent in this
respect are those of Schloesing, Müntz, Hatton,
Warrington, Sorby, Winogradsky, Percy Frankland,
Dupré, Emich and Dibdin. That set of researches,
however, which has done more than any other to
consolidate the theory of bio-chemical changes taking
place in the self-purification of sewage are the investigations
of the Massachusetts State Board of Health, which
were commenced in November 1887, and are still being
continued.</p>

<p>Since 1895 a large number of additional experiments
have been made, which will be dealt with more in detail
later on, but speaking generally they have not materially
increased our knowledge of the processes taking place in
sewage purification.</p>

<p><!--041.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 33]</span>
Summarising the remarks on the theoretical aspect of
this question, it may be said that, as to the agencies at
work, we know now they are of a mechanical, chemical
and biological nature; but as to the processes and
products brought about by these agencies we know
very little beyond the initial and terminal stages, as
will be pointed out in some of the subsequent observations.</p>

<p>Directing now attention to the practical side of the
question, it has already been stated that the only known
sewage treatment at the commencement of last century
was land irrigation. Then about the middle of the
century chemistry seems to have taken the matter in
hand and tried to make a lucrative business out of it.
It is on record, however, that it did not succeed in this
attempt, and the financial loss which this endeavour has
caused is a dismal subject to investigate.</p>

<p>There is before my mind’s eye the case of a gallant
officer of His Majesty’s land forces who, after having
reached very near the summit of his career, retired and
employed his time in trying to make a fortune out of
sewage. So enamoured was he of the subject, that&mdash;so
the story goes&mdash;he commuted his pension to have all the
more ready money; but fortune did not smile on him,
and his last days were spent under the lengthening
shadows of the sorrow of financial difficulties, having
practically lost all he possessed.</p>

<p>The emphatic verdict of the first Sewage Commission
of 1857, the first and second Rivers Pollution Commission,
and, indeed, of all other authoritative investigations,
was in favour of land treatment; and it cannot, therefore,
be surprising to find that the Local Government Board
insisted, save in exceptional cases, that “any scheme of
sewage disposal, for which money is to be borrowed with
<!--042.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 34]</span>
their sanction, should provide for the application of the
sewage or effluent to an adequate area of suitable land
before it is discharged into a stream.” Indeed, had this
body taken any different view and neglected the findings
of practically all authoritative inquiries, it would have
been singularly deficient in the discharge of its duties to
the ratepayers of this country.</p>

<p>But the best of land cannot go on for ever doing its
duty if by systematic neglect and ignorance the essential
conditions for successful purification are year after year
violated; and the great pity is that the Local Government
Board, after deciding in favour of land treatment,
did not systematically superintend this operation. It
may not have had the power, but it is quite evident that
had it done so, things would not have drifted from bad
to worse, until local authorities, driven to despair by the
apparent failure of land and not discerning the right
cause, refused altogether to be ruled by what seemed to
them a very unfair and absurd restriction.</p>

<p>It was at this time that Mr. Dibdin, who, on behalf
of the London County Council, had been carrying out a
set of valuable experiments, came forward with his
application of well known theories to sewage operations
on a large scale. As I pointed out at the time,
Mr. Dibdin’s experiments proved beyond a doubt that
the application of sewage to suitable land was right in
principle and that the failures were brought about by the
non-observance of the rules laid down by this gentleman&mdash;that,
in fact, sewage irrigation was the only natural
method of sewage purification and that all the other
methods were artificial. I described land treatment as the
natural self-purification of sewage and the oxidation or
contact bed system as the artificial self-purification of
sewage.</p>

<p><!--043.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 35]</span>
But the swift current of public opinion had set very
strongly against sewage farms, and nothing but the contact
bed treatment would do. A large number of
experimental plants on this system grew up like mushrooms
all over the country, and the waves of enthusiasm
seemed at one time to engulf even the Local Government
Board itself with its “antiquated notions,” until Parliament
came to the rescue and appointed on May 7, 1898,
a new Royal Commission to study the question of sewage
purification.</p>

<p>This Commission consists of nine members,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_4" id="fnanchor_4"></a><a href="#footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span>
 i.e. six
professional men and three laymen. Of the professional
men, one is a biologist, one a chemist, two are medical
men in administrative positions, and two are engineers
likewise in administrative positions. Of the laymen two
are members of special boards for the prevention of
the pollution of rivers.</p>

<p>So far the Commissioners have issued an Interim
Report dated July 12, 1901, a volume of evidence
and a volume of appendices. Quite lately, it is
stated, they have issued a further Interim Report, to
which are attached separate reports on some special
subjects by their officers, but this report has not yet
come to hand.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_5" id="fnanchor_5"></a><a href="#footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span>
</p>

<p>At the time of their first Interim Report, July 12, 1901,
the Commissioners had held altogether thirty-five sittings,
the first of which was on June 22, 1898, and the last on
May 22, 1901. The period thus covered is nearly two
years, and out of the thirty-five sittings thirty took place
in London, and five in the provinces, <abbr title="namely"><abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr></abbr> at Leeds, Ripon,
Manchester, Accrington and Reigate.</p>

<p><!--044.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 36]</span>
On these occasions, all in all, fifty-eight witnesses
were examined, who may be grouped as follows:</p>

<table summary="">
<tr><td class="right">1</td><td class="left">Zoologist</td></tr>
<tr><td class="right"> 1</td><td class="left">Botanist</td></tr>
<tr><td class="right"> 2</td><td class="left">Laymen</td></tr>
<tr><td class="right"> 3</td><td class="left">Bacteriologists</td></tr>
<tr><td class="right"> 5</td><td class="left">Lawyers</td></tr>
<tr><td class="right"> 7</td><td class="left">Medical men</td></tr>
<tr><td class="right">11</td><td class="left">Patentees</td></tr>
<tr><td class="right">14</td><td class="left">Chemists</td></tr>
<tr><td class="right">14</td><td class="left">Engineers</td></tr>
<tr><td class="center" colspan="2"><br />58 witnesses in all.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Out of this number twenty-five were officials, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> five
lawyers, six medical men, six chemists and eight engineers.
Four officials were further managers of artificial sewage
purification works, but not one single manager of natural
purification works, i.e. a sewage farm manager, was
called, the term “sewage farm manager” being used here
to indicate an official whose sole duty it is to manage a
sewage farm.</p>

<p>The entire absence of this latter class of official is so
striking that it cannot be due to accident, but must be
the outcome of a settled policy not to reopen questions
conclusively settled by previous inquiries.</p>

<p>Another point that strikes the observer is that the
Commission only called one zoologist and one botanist,
as it is to these scientists that belongs in the first instance
the question of studying the fauna and flora of sewage
before the subject is taken up by other branches of
natural science.</p>

<p>Speaking on the whole, the evidence taken by the
Commissioners forms very interesting reading, and ought
to be carefully studied by those who have to deal with
the subject. When now and again opinions are
expressed, which seem directly opposed to each other, it
must be borne in mind that here, as in other things
human, unanimity of opinion, though much desired, is
apparently unobtainable.</p>

<p><!--045.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 37]</span>
To understand the conclusions fully, at which the
Commissioners in their Interim Report have arrived, it
ought to be pointed out that they had either to accept
the recommendations in favour of land passed by all
previous Royal Commissions and authoritative inquiries,
or they had to show by incontestable evidence that their
predecessors had made grievous mistakes, and where!</p>

<p>Of these two courses, the present Commissioners have
adopted, no doubt for very good reasons of their own,
the first, and they have started therefore, in the conclusions
to which they have come, at the point where previous
inquiries had left off, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> that land treatment is a very
proper method of sewage purification.</p>

<p>But before referring more in particular to their observations
on land treatment, it will be necessary to point
out that the Commissioners evidently divide all methods
of sewage purification into two main classes, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> natural
and artificial methods. Into the former they only place
land treatment, whilst they call all other methods
artificial.</p>

<p>This division seems to have given a great deal of
offence to all those who have expressed decided and frequently
very one-sided views in favour of the “bacterial”
treatment of sewage; but on closer examination it cannot
be denied that the Commissioners were quite right in
forming this view, as the following remarks will show.</p>

<p>For main divisions of all methods of sewage treatment
two factors seem to be of primary importance, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> the
agencies which bring about this purification, and the way
in which these agencies are employed. Now, it will not
be denied that all agencies are natural ones, whether the
process employed is a purely chemical one, a purely
“bacterial” one, land treatment pure and simple, or a
combination of these, and, at the present time no such
<!--046.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 38]</span>
thing as an artificial agency is known; indeed, it is
perhaps not too much to say that there cannot be such a
thing as an artificial agency. Hence it is impossible to
divide sewage purification methods in this respect by the
agencies employed, and one is bound to fall back upon
the way in which these agencies are employed. Here it
is no longer open to argument whether a chemical process
or the contact bed system&mdash;oxidation bed system&mdash;is
artificial, or whether the land treatment is natural! For
who would deny that masonry or concrete tanks and the
materials contained in the same are artificial products&mdash;i.e.
products formed by man&mdash;and that land is a natural
product&mdash;i.e. formed by nature&mdash;and that further the soil
is the natural home of bacteria. Hence it must be
perfectly clear, even to a casual observer, that the line of
demarcation drawn by the Commissioners between all
known systems of sewage purification is a correct and
legitimate one, and that all objections to such a division
are based on misconceptions.</p>

<p>Concerning land treatment, the Commissioners
observe, “We doubt if any land is entirely useless,” but
further on they observe that peat and stiff clay lands are
generally unsuitable for the purification of sewage. Concerning
peat, nobody acquainted with the subject would
probably differ from their conclusions owing to the great
amount of moisture contained in this material; but as to
clay soils, the Commissioners when making this statement
must have known that there are several successful sewage
farms on this kind of land in existence, such as the
sewage farms at South Norwood, Wimbledon, Warwick
and Leicester, not to mention others. In the case of
Leicester, although the land is a very dense boulder clay,
the Corporation of this town have just purchased the freehold
of the farm for about 160,000<abbr title="pounds" class="pounds">l.</abbr></p>

<p><!--047.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 39]</span>
Dealing with the artificial processes from a chemical
point of view, the Commissioners are of opinion that it is
practicable to produce by these processes alone, either
from sewage or from certain mixtures of sewage and trade
refuse, effluents which might be discharged without fear
of creating a nuisance, and that in consequence the Local
Government Board would be justified in modifying, under
proper safeguards, the present rule as regards the application
of sewage to land.</p>

<p>The artificial processes referred to in the observations
appear to be the following:&mdash;&#8203;</p>

<p class="indent">
Closed septic tanks and contact beds.<br />
Open septic tanks and contact beds.<br />
Chemical treatment, subsidence<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_6" id="fnanchor_6"></a><a href="#footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span>
 tanks and contact beds.<br />
Subsidence tanks and contact beds.<br />
Contact beds alone.<br />
Closed septic tank followed by continuous filtration.<br />
Open septic tank followed by continuous filtration.<br />
Chemical treatment, subsidence tanks, and continuous filtration.<br />
Subsidence tanks followed by continuous filtration.<br />
Continuous filtration alone.</p>

<p>The Commissioners do not say what these safeguards
are, in fact they state that no general rules concerning
them can be laid down, and that in the case of these
artificial processes it is necessary to consider every case
on its own merits.</p>

<p>The next point dealt with is the bacteriological
quality of effluents, and here the Commissioners observe:
“We find that, while in the case of effluents from land of
a kind suitable for the purification of sewage there are
<!--048.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 40]</span>
fewer micro-organisms than in the effluents from most
artificial processes, yet both classes of effluents usually
contain large numbers of organisms, many of which
appear to be of intestinal derivation, and some of which
are of a kind liable under certain circumstances at least
to give rise to disease.”</p>

<p>No particulars of effluents from sewage farms are
given, and later on it will be shown that this conclusion
of the Commissioners is not in accord with the results
published up to now and available concerning the
bacterial purity of effluents from land treatment.</p>

<p>The report concludes with some remarks on rivers
pollution. The Commissioners state that it is of the
utmost importance to provide the simplest possible means
for adequately protecting all rivers, and they think that
this subject is of such grave importance “as to demand
the creation of a separate Commission or a new department
of the Local Government Board, which shall be a
supreme Rivers Authority, dealing with matters relating
to rivers and their purification, and which, when appeal
is made to them, shall have power to take action in cases
where the local authorities have failed to do so.”</p>

<p>Summing up the observations on the practice of
sewage treatment, it may be said that as a result of their
extended inquiries, the present Royal Commissioners
have at the end of the century re-established land in its
position as the first and only natural method of sewage
purification, beside which they have recognised artificial
(biological) treatments as being under proper safeguards
admissible for the purification of sewage.</p>

<p>Before concluding this portion of the observations, it
is necessary to mention the valuable work done by
Mr. Scott-Moncrieff and Mr. Cameron, who, contemporaneous
with Mr. Dibdin, but quite independently, had
<!--049.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 41]</span>
experimented with sewage and evolved their own
artificial methods of sewage treatment.</p>

<p>These remarks must suffice for the more historic
portion of the subject, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> the progress of sewage
purification during the last century, and it is time now
to direct attention first to natural and afterwards to
artificial sewage treatments.</p>

<div class="p2 sidenote">General remarks on subsoil and its properties.</div>
<p>Before dealing more in detail with the processes
taking place in the pores of the subsoil of sewage farms,
it may not be out of place to make here a few general
observations on the mechanical structure of soil, its permeability,
water capacity, retentive power, the capillary
movements in the same, its temperature, the subsoil
air, the movement of water in and through the same,
the micro-organic life in soil, and its absorbing powers.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc"><a name="mechanical" id="mechanical"></a>
1. Mechanical Structure of Soil.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Size of grain and pores.</div>
<p>Here is of interest the size of the grains or particles
composing the soil, the size of the pores and their
collective capacity.</p>

<p>According to the character of the soil, its grains or
particles will vary from very large in coarse gravel to
very fine in fine sand and clay.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Variable size of pores.<br /><br />
Surface attraction.</div>
<p class="pb">The size of the pores will vary as the size of its
grains from large to small, but frequently a certain
kind of soil will contain a mixture of large and small
pores.  The finer the pores the more energetic will, as
a rule, be the surface attraction of the grains composing
the soil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pore-volume.
<!--050.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 42]</span><br /><br />
With particles of equal size pore-volume amounts to about 38 per cent. of the total space, and sinks down to 10 or 15 per cent. with particles of unequal size.<br /><br />
With equally sized particles the pore-volume is the same whether the particles are small or large.</div>
<p class="pb8">The collective capacity of the pores or the pore-volume
mainly depends on the equal or unequal sizes of the
particles. When the same are of equal size the pore-volume
amounts to about 38 per cent. of the total space
occupied by the soil, but when this is not the case it may
sink to as low as from 10 to 15 per cent. of this space.
With equally sized particles the pore-volume is the same
whether the individual particles are large or small. In
nature it will be the exception to find all the particles of
equal size, such a condition of things prevails only when
careful sorting by sifting or riddling has taken place,
and in the majority of cases the larger pores will be

<div class="sidenote">Permeability depends first on the size of the pores, and secondly on the pore-volume.</div>
<p class="pb3">The permeability of a soil for the passage of air and
water depends, in the first instance, on the size of the
pores, and is further to some extent influenced by the
pore-volume.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of large and small pores.</div>
<p class="pb">Soil with large pores will offer but little resistance to
the passage of air and water, but when the pores are
small these movements will be greatly impeded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Permeability is proportional to the fourth power of the pore-diameter.</div>
<p class="pb">It has been ascertained that the permeability of soils
is proportional to the fourth power of the diameter of
the pores, so that it decreases very rapidly with the
diminishing size of the pores.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In frozen soil permeability decreases rapidly.</div>
<p>In subsoil with small pores all movements of air
practically cease when it is half full of water, and in
frozen soil the decrease of the permeability is still more
marked.</p>

the pore-volume.
For very accurate measurements allowance
must be made for a small amount of air, which even
after filling remains in the pores and cannot be dislodged,
but for practical purposes this can be overlooked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1 cubic yard of soil with particles of equal size will hold about 85 gallons of water.</div>
<p>As has already been stated, the pore-volume of a soil
consisting of equal particles throughout, amounts to
about 38 per cent. of the space occupied by it, and
1 cubic yard of such a soil&mdash;whether we have to deal

<p class="pb10">Soil with a large pore-volume and with a large

Clean gravel will retain about 12 per cent. of its water capacity,

retain as much as 84 per cent. of its water capacity, i.e.
about 70 gallons per cubic yard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Organically polluted soil retains more water than clean soil.</div>
<p class="pb">This will explain why a polluted subsoil containing a

water than the same soil in a clean condition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The retentive power of a soil is due to its surface attractions.</div>
<p class="pb3">The retentive power of a soil is due to the surface
attraction of its particles, and when the space between
them is small, or when, in other words, the pores are small,
this attractive power will be all the greater.</p>

been reached, of water are poured upon the soil, a portion of the

<p class="pb8">It is further of interest to observe here, that if after
the limit of the retentive power has been reached further
quantities of water are poured upon the soil, the water
<!--052.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 44]</span>
retained in the lower layers will commence to drain away.
This means that the water freshly poured upon the soil
will drive out a portion of the water previously stored in
the pores. It is important to bear this in mind when
dealing with polluted water, as owing to this action the
water penetrating into deeper layers will to some extent
at least have become purified in the upper layers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Capillary attraction causes an upward movement of the water.</div>
<p class="pb">Through capillary attraction an ascending movement
of the water is caused in direct opposition to the laws of
gravity, and the height to which water will thus ascend
depends mainly on the smallness of the pores; large
pores do not assist in this movement. As the same,
however, extends over the whole pore-volume the quantity
of water thus raised may exceed the water-retentive
power of soil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Capillary attraction also causes lateral and downward movements.</div>
<p class="pb">In addition to the upward movement brought about by
capillary attraction, this power is also continually at work
in a lateral and downward direction; but for the present
purposes only the upward movement will be noticed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Time occupied by upward movement. Height reached by upward movement.</div>
<p>In observing the upward movement, it is interesting
to notice the time occupied by it and the total height
reached. As to the time occupied, it has been established
that the upward movement in gravel and coarse
sand is much quicker than in fine and loamy sand, but
the heights attained are reversed. For whereas the
height in a material consisting of coarse or large pores
amounts to from 2 inches to 4 inches; a height of about
4 feet after thirty to thirty-five days has been recorded
in fine or loamy sand; in peaty soil one observer states
that the upward movement of the water may reach a
height of 20 feet.</p>

<a name="temperat" id="temperat"></a>6. Temperature of Soil.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Three principal sources of heat.</div>
<p>The earth’s crust receives its supply of heat from three
principal sources, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>:</p>

<p>1. From the sun through its rays;</p>

<p>2. From the interior of the earth through conduction;
and</p>

<p>3. From various physical and chemical processes
which take place in it and create heat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Heat through sun’s rays.<br /><br />
Dark soils absorb more heat than light-coloured soils.<br /><br />
Capacity for heat is greater in damp and fine-grained soils.<br /><br />
Evaporation and condensation of aqueous vapour produce the greatest effect in fine-grained soils.</div>
<p class="pb10">Dealing with the upper layers of the crust, it may be
said that, besides the intensity of the sun’s rays, the temperature
also depends on a variety of properties possessed
by various kinds of soil,
amongst which latter may be
mentioned the absorption of heat, which is much greater
in dark than in light-coloured soils;
the heat conductivity
and the capacity for heat, which lead to higher temperatures
in damp and fine-grained soils;
and finally the
evaporation and condensation of aqueous vapour, which
tend to prevent extremes of heat and cold and which
likewise produce the greatest effects in fine-grained
soils.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A fine-grained damp soil does not get so hot, but retains the heat better.</div>
<p class="pb">It follows from these observations that a coarse-grained,
dark coloured and dry soil will show the highest
and lowest temperatures, whereas a fine-grained damp
soil does not get so hot but retains the heat better.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The temperature of the surface of the soil may exceed that of the air.</div>
<p class="pb">It ought to be pointed out in this place that a variety
of circumstances may bring about very high temperatures
on the surface of the ground which considerably
exceed the average temperatures of the air at the same
time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Laws regulating the subsoil temperatures.</div>
<p>Concerning the laws that have been deduced from
careful and long continued observations of subsoil temperatures,
it will not be necessary at this point to deal
<!--054.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 46]</span>
minutely with them; it must on the contrary suffice to
summarise only the more important ones.</p>

<p>With the distance from the surface of the ground,</p>

<p>1. The differences of temperature become less,</p>

<p>2. The temperatures are retarded, and</p>

<p>3. The variations of short durations gradually
disappear.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Subsoil temperatures 18 <abbr title="inches">in.</abbr> below surface.<br /><br />
Subsoil temperatures at depths of 4 <abbr title="feet">ft.</abbr> 6 <abbr title="inches">in.</abbr> and 9 <abbr title="feet">ft.</abbr></div>
<p class="pb4">At a depth of 18 inches below the surface the daily
fluctuations are hardly observable, the temperature
differences of various days become obscured, the differences
between the monthly mean temperatures are less
by several degrees, and the yearly fluctuation amounts
only to about 10° C.
At a depth of 4 feet 6 inches the
latter is only 4° C., and at a depth of 9 feet it is only
1°C.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Subsoil temperatures at depths from 9 <abbr title="feet">ft.</abbr> to 33 <abbr title="feet">ft.</abbr></div>
<p class="pb">Between 9 and 33 feet, according to the yearly mean
of the surface, the yearly fluctuation ceases and the
temperature remains the same throughout the year.</p>

<p>Below this point an increase of temperature is observable
towards the earth’s centre, which amounts to
about 1° C. for every 40 feet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Retardation of temperatures with increase in depth.</div>
<p>Concerning the retardation of the temperatures with
an increase in depth below the surface, it is interesting to
point out that this, according to Fodor, amounts to about
three weeks for every yard, so that the yearly maximum
at a depth of 1 yard will take place in August, at a depth
of 2 yards in the beginning of September, and at a depth
of 4 yards in October. This is on the assumption that
the maximum temperature of the atmospheric air is
reached in July.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Frost depth about 3 <abbr title="feet">ft.</abbr></div>
<p>The depth to which frost under ordinary conditions
penetrates is about 3 feet, but there are cases on record
where water pipes at depths of from 4 to 5 feet have been
frozen up during long continued severe frost.</p>

<a name="subsoil" id="subsoil"></a>7. Subsoil Air.</span>
<!--055.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Subsoil air is saturated with aqueous vapour and contains large quantities of carbonic acid.</div>
<p class="pb">The pores of soil are either partly or wholly filled
with air, which as a rule is saturated with aqueous vapour.
This air consists very largely of carbonic acid (from 0·2
to 14 per cent., on an average from 2 to 3 per cent.) and
to a small extent of oxygen, which has been used up for
the formation of carbonic acid. It also contains traces of
ammonia and gases of decomposition.</p>

<p>The movements of subsoil air need not be considered
here, and beyond these few general observations it will
not be necessary to deal with the subject.</p>

<a name="mvmnts" id="mvmnts"></a>8. Movements of Water in Soil.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Strata above level of subsoil water.</div>
<p>Two main strata may here be distinguished in subsoil,
one above the level of the subsoil water and one below
this level. The latter strata do not interest us, and those
above the level of the subsoil<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_7" id="fnanchor_7"></a><a href="#footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span>
 water may again be subdivided
into three zones, which in descending order are
as follows:--&#8203;</p>

<p class="indent">The evaporation zone;<br />
The passage zone; and<br />
The capillary zone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">One-third of the rain-water evaporates. One-third flows off the surface. One-third percolates.</div>
<p class="pb">All these three zones must be passed by the water in
its descent from the surface of the ground to the subsoil
water level, and the quantity of water retained by them
will depend on their state of dryness. Speaking quite
generally and within wide limits, one-third of the rain-water
flows off the surface, one-third evaporates, and one-third
percolates into the subsoil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evaporation zone.</div>
<p><!--056.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 48]</span>
The evaporation zone reaches from the surface of the
soil to that point below, which marks the extent of the
drying influence of the atmospheric air. In the same the
quantity of water stored in the pores may at times sink
below the retentive power of the soil, i.e. below that
quantity which can be retained in the pores owing to the
mechanical powers of adhesion, etc. When it has
become very dry through evaporation and other causes
the zone, especially when it extends some way down,
may retain large quantities of water. In a depth of
10 inches, 1 square yard of soil, with fine pores, may
retain about 10 gallons of water, and as a rainfall of
½ inch produces only 2·3 gallons per square yard, it is
clear that subsoil of this nature may retain a number of
successive showers. During the height of summer fine
porous soil may become so dry that practically no water
finds its way into deeper zones; in this state the
evaporation zone can be compared to a large sponge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Passage zone.</div>
<p>The next zone traversed by the water in its downward
movement is the passage zone, which lies beyond
the drying influence of atmospheric air. When too far
removed from the level of the subsoil water, its pores will
not be completely filled with water, but will only contain
that amount which is due to the retentive powers of the
soil. By direct measurement it has been found that on
an average a cubic yard of fine porous soil will retain
from 30 to 80 gallons of water, and it can easily be
calculated that in a layer from 1 to 2 yards in thickness
the rainfall of a whole year may be retained. The
passage zone, especially if it is of considerable thickness,
represents a very large storage reservoir.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Capillary zone.</div>
<p>The last zone before the level of the subsoil water is
reached is the capillary zone, in which the pores are
partially or wholly filled by the upward movement&mdash;due
<!--057.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 49]</span>
to capillary attraction&mdash;from the subsoil water. The
extent of this filling will depend on the size of the
pores.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="side" id="side"></a>Springs.</div>
<p>When the descending water has finally reached the
subsoil water it either comes to a standstill altogether on
the impervious layer or moves along the same, if the
latter is not horizontal, until it may eventually leave the
subsoil again by issuing therefrom in the form of visible
or invisible springs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rate of downward movement governed by pores.</div>
<p class="pb">The rate of movement of any liquid&mdash;rain-water,
sewage or other polluting liquid&mdash;is largely governed by
the size of the pores. Where these are large, as for
instance in coarse gravel, the descent of the water will be
comparatively rapid, but when they are small it may
take a very long time before the water reaches the level
of the subsoil water, and in that case it will have undergone
material changes as regards its chemical or bacterial
composition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">With a high level of subsoil water zones become indistinguishable.</div>
<p class="pb">With a high level of subsoil water the zones may
become indistinguishable, one zone reaching into the
other, with the result that the whole of the soil becomes
very wet.</p>

<p>When subsoil has been artificially drained the amount
of water reaching the subsoil water below the general
level of the drains will depend on the size of the latter
and the distance between them. In such a case the
downward movement of the water through undrained
soil, previously described, may be further interfered with
through the ventilation of the subsoil by drains, and the
drying up action caused thereby.</p>

<p class="p2 footnote"> <a name="footnote_7" id="footnote_7"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_7"><span class="muchsmaller">[7]</span></a>
The term subsoil water is here used to denote that portion of the
water in the pores of the soil, which is either at rest on or moves along the
inclined plane of an impervious layer.</p>

<!--058.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Soil probably original home of micro-organisms.<br /><br />
Distribution of micro-organisms in soil.</div>
<p class="pb">The soil is probably the original home of all micro-organisms,
from which they have emigrated into other
media. It contains vast numbers, and, according to some
observers, 1 <abbr title="cubic centimeter">ccm.</abbr> may hold 100,000 germs. By far the
greater number is found on or near the surface, and in
lower layers the numbers gradually diminish, until at last
a depth is reached, which depends on local conditions,
where the soil is perfectly sterile.
The aerobes live near
the surface and carry on their work in this region,
whereas the anaerobes are at work lower down in the
soil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cycle of micro-organic activity during the year.</div>
<p>The picture of the cycle of micro-organic activity in
the upper layers of the soil during the various seasons of
the year is probably the following. In winter, especially
during that period when frost and ice bind the earth,
micro-organic life is apparently at its lowest ebb, and
may in some very cold climates come to a standstill
altogether, when micro-organisms may be said to hold
their vegetative winter sleep. With the return of life and
the awakening of nature in spring&mdash;especially with the
approach of higher temperatures and the formation of
moisture&mdash;micro-organic activity once more makes itself
felt all round. During the summer months it is exposed
to some injurious influences such as the heating and
drying up of the upper layers of the soil, but, still
gradually increasing, micro-organisms reach the climax
of their activity during the autumnal rains, to remain in
this state until with the advent of the cold season their
activity gradually declines again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Micro-organic life in layers from 3 <abbr title="feet">ft.</abbr> to 6 <abbr title="feet">ft.</abbr> in depth.</div>
<p>In the lower layers of the soil, down to 3 feet and
6 feet, micro-organisms are more protected against the
injurious influences of the atmosphere, sunlight and
<!--059.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 51]</span>
drying up, but the want of oxygen, together with the
greater difficulty of removing such products as carbonic
acid, has an injurious influence. As the temperature in
these layers is considerably more uniform, it may be
inferred that the micro-organic activity is there of a more
uniform kind, less influenced by sudden changes, probably
also less intense, but without pronounced periods of
rest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Micro-organisms probably quickly perish in depths greater than 6 <abbr title="feet">ft.</abbr></div>
<p class="pb">In depths greater than 6 feet micro-organisms probably
perish very quickly owing to unfavourable conditions,
and if found their presence must be explained
by emigration from higher layers, not by actual growth
at these depths.</p>

<p>On sewage farms the micro-organic activity is without
doubt greatly modified, and proceeds all the year round
at a more uniform rate than on ordinary land, as the
sewage always contains the necessary warmth and
moisture so beneficial for it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Absorbing powers due to surface attraction of the particles of the soil.<br /><br />
The finer the pores the greater the absorption.</div>
<p class="pb6">The absorbing powers of soil are due to the surface
attraction of its particles or grains, and these, as has
already been pointed out, will be all the greater the finer
the pores are;
they extend on the one hand to aqueous
and other vapours and gases, and on the other to matters
in solution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1 <abbr title="cubic yard">cub. yd.</abbr> of coarse gravel may contain 50 <abbr title="square yards">sq. yds.</abbr> of surface and 1 <abbr title="cubic yard">cub. yd.</abbr> of fine sand 9200 <abbr title="square yards">sq. yds.</abbr></div>
<p class="pb">That the attractive force of the surface of the
particles is pretty considerable will be at once apparent
when it is stated that 1 cubic yard of coarse gravel may
contain about 140,000 grains with a combined surface of
50 square yards, and 1 cubic yard of fine sand 40 million
grains with a combined surface of 9200 square yards,
which is a little under 2 acres.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Deodorising action of soil absorption of gases.</div>
<p class="pb"><!--060.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 52]</span>
Concerning the absorption by soil of aqueous vapour
and gases (apart from condensation through a fall in
temperature), dry soil with fine pores acts most
energetically. The almost instantaneous deodorisation
of foul-smelling gases, such as are formed by decomposing
fæcal matters (earth closet) or coal gas, through a thin
layer of fine dry soil is well known, and is to be explained
in this way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Absorption of dissolved substances by soil.</div>
<p>More interesting still, and also more important, is the
absorption of dissolved substances by soil. In this way
is to be explained the decolorising effect and the
retention of dissolved polluting substances such as are
contained in sewage. In the same way soil has the
power of destroying such poisons as strychnine, nicotine,
coniine, etc., and the experiments of Falk and others go
to show that ptomaines and toxines are likewise retained
and rendered harmless by it. This absorbing power of
soil is of the utmost importance in agriculture, and without
it soil could not possess purifying powers for polluting
liquids. It is quite true that in this process of purification
other factors play an important part, but they could
not come into play if this absorption did not exist.</p>

<p>The absorbing powers of soil are in some way
dependent on the presence of micro-organisms and air,
and in the absence of these they will soon come to a
standstill.</p>

<abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> SELF-PURIFYING POWERS OF SOIL.
NATURAL SELF-PURIFICATION OF
SEWAGE.</h3>

<div class="p2 sidenote">Self-purifying powers of soil.</div>
<p>After these preliminary remarks it becomes necessary
now to examine into the self-purifying powers of soil
with special reference to sewage farms. Generally
<!--061.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 53]</span>
speaking, the term “self-purifying powers of soil”
comprises all those processes which go on on the surface
and in the pores of the soil of sewage farms, and by
which polluting liquids such as sewage become purified
as these take place under natural conditions and in a
natural medium, the process of land treatment of sewage
is called&mdash;see previous observations&mdash;"the natural self-purification
of sewage.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Self-purifying powers vary with local conditions.<br /><br />
Soil best suited for sewage farms.</div>
<p class="pb">It should be stated at the outset that the self-purifying
powers of soil will depend largely on the soil
itself and the local conditions under which they come
into play, so that observations made in one locality will
not be immediately applicable to others without making
full allowance for the differences; this will be clear from
the preliminary remarks as to the character and
properties of soils made in the previous pages.
As will
be pointed out more in detail later on, a subsoil that
combines great permeability for air with high retaining
and absorbing powers, is best suited for sewage farms.</p>

<p>Let us now consider what becomes of water, sewage
or any other polluting liquid containing organic substances
after it has been poured out upon the surface
of the ground, and for this purpose we will assume a
subsoil of a suitable character and in fair condition for
work with proper under-drainage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Retention of liquid by pores of soil.</div>
<p>The liquid thus poured out upon the surface will
sooner or later disappear in the soil, and will at first be
retained in the pores of the zone of evaporation, which
may be said to extend to the level of the under-drains.
This retention is due to the retentive powers of soil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Suspended matters retained on the surface, soil acts like a sieve.<br /><br />
Coating of surface of the land.<br /><br />
Removal of suspended matters generally an advantage.</div>
<p class="pb8">Portion of the suspended matters will be retained on
the surface and the rest will be strained out in a
mechanical manner in the pores, the soil acting as a
sieve more or less fine according to its character. If
<!--062.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 54]</span>
the suspended matters are present in very large quantities
it may happen that they will gradually form a
coat on the surface of the land and choke the pores to
the exclusion of air, and as this is a thing to be avoided
in sewage farming it is in most cases advisable to remove
them out of the liquid before it is poured upon the
land.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The more finely divided the suspended matters are, the lighter the work of the land.</div>
<p class="pb">Even where such a removal has taken place there
will still be left a certain portion of the suspended matters,
and if these are in a finely divided state, such as is
probably the result of their passage through fine strainers
or pump valves, the work of the land will be considerably
lightened.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Micro-organisms screened out in a mechanical way.</div>
<p class="pb">The micro-organisms contained in the liquid will be
to a large extent screened out in a mechanical way with
the suspended matters and deposited on the surface and
in the upper layers of the soil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Retention of matters in solution after removal out of the liquid is due to physical and chemical agencies.</div>
<p class="pb6">The matters in solution will partly, after removal out
of the liquid, be retained by the absorbing powers of the
soil in the pores, a process that is due to physical and
chemical agencies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Absorbing powers gradually ripen.</div>
<p>It is well known that land which is being treated
with sewage for the first time does not purify sewage so
well as land that has been under systematic treatment
for some time, and this is probably due to the absorbing
powers, which gradually ripen until they have reached
their maximum of efficiency.
This process of gradual
improvement seems to be due to the formation of a slimy
coating round each particle of soil, which growth does
not only assist mechanical filtration, but also possesses
high powers of absorbing oxygen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Depths to which polluting substances may penetrate into soil.</div>
<p>The depth to which polluting substances may penetrate
into soil will probably differ in each case, but the
following factors may be said to influence it, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> the
<!--063.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 55]</span>
velocity of the downward flow, the nature and degree of
the polluting liquid, and the character of the soil. Where,
therefore, the powers of the soil are over-taxed the
polluting substances may reach the level of the underdrains
and pass out through them, in which case the
effluent will be but little better than the raw liquid. It
must be the aim of careful management to avoid this.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Process of decomposition of organic matters stored in soil during periods of rest.</div>
<p class="pb">The polluting substances of an organic nature thus
stored in the pores undergo here&mdash;and that probably
chiefly during periods of rest&mdash;a process of decomposition
or disintegration, which goes on until the whole of the
organic matter has been converted into stable mineral
forms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Explanation of the term “self-purifying power of soil.”</div>
<p class="pb">This process of retention, absorption and decomposition
of organic impurities is called “the self-purifying
power of soil.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">After conversion substances are removed out of the soil by the plants, by the subsoil air and subsoil water.</div>
<p class="pb">The substances thus converted do not remain in the
pores, but they are removed either by the plants, for
which they act as food, or by the currents of subsoil air,
or by the subsoil water, and as the removal of fertilising
substances by the subsoil water indicates a waste it must
be the aim of a careful management to utilise them as
much as ever possible for the benefit of the plants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Process of digestion. “Sewage sick.”</div>
<p>The whole of these intricate and very complicated
changes may be likened to the process of digestion in
animals, and when these digestive powers are overtaxed
signs of sickness may be noticed as the inevitable result,
which increase until, in sewage phraseology, the land
becomes “sewage sick.” In this condition it remains
until the flow of the polluting liquid is stopped, when
after a period of rest&mdash;recreative period&mdash;the digestive
powers gradually return and begin to do their work
afresh.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Action of lime.</div>
<p>When the soil of a sewage farm has got into this
<!--064.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 56]</span>
state, owing to having received heavy doses of sewage,
the application of lime has proved very beneficial by
accelerating the process of nitrification, and in this
respect interesting experiments have been made on the
Berlin sewage farms. The action of lime is said to be a
twofold one.</p>

<p>1. It quickly attacks and splits up the organic matters
and accelerates afterwards their decomposition and their
utilisation by plants; and</p>

<p>2. It neutralises the excess of acid in the soil, and
causes the latter to part with its carbonic acid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decomposition proceeds quickest at or near the surface.</div>
<p class="pb">The process of decomposition proceeds as a rule
at a much quicker rate on the surface and in the
upper layers of the soil, where, as already mentioned, the
number of micro-organisms is greatest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">When carefully worked there is no time limit to the purifying powers of the soil.</div>
<p class="pb3">It has been maintained that the soil of sewage farms
will after a while silt up and cease to purify sewage,
but the results obtained with carefully managed farms
clearly disprove this, and under these conditions there
appears to be no limit as to time to the purifying power
of soil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Depth of soil necessary for purification.</div>
<p>Concerning the depth of soil&mdash;evaporation zone&mdash;that
is necessary for the successful retention, absorption and
decomposition of sewage, no generally applicable rule
can be laid down, as this will depend on a variety of
factors, amongst which may be mentioned: the character
and thickness of the top soil (humus), the nature and cultivation
of the top soil; the character of the subsoil&mdash;its
permeability for air and its retaining and absorbing
powers; the surface slopes of the land and the level of
the subsoil water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Greater depths than 4 <abbr title="feet">ft.</abbr> will be rarely necessary.</div>
<p class="pb">On some farms a depth of 3 feet on an average has
proved sufficient, and on others the drains have been
laid at depths ranging between 3 and 6 feet, but very
<!--065.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 57]</span>
special reasons ought to be shown for all depths over
4 feet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Soil best suited for sewage farms.</div>
<p>Whilst practically no soil is entirely useless for sewage
farming, with the exception perhaps of peat, owing to the
quantity of moisture it contains, a soil that combines
great permeability for air with high retaining and absorbing
powers&mdash;such as a loamy sand with fairly large grains&mdash;is
probably the best.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Clay soil not unsuitable for sewage farms, but it necessitates a greater area of land.</div>
<p class="pb">It has been maintained that clay, owing to its impervious
character, is totally unsuitable for sewage farming,
but the experience of such farms as South Norwood,
Wimbledon, Warwick and Leicester disproves this. It
is true, however, that as the purifying powers of the soil
are restricted in a vertical sense to the upper layers, it
may become necessary in places to extend the area of
the farm beyond what would be necessary with a more
pervious soil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Changes observed in the heavy clay land at Leicester since sewage treatment was commenced.</div>
<p>It may not be without interest to draw attention here
to some of the changes that have taken place on the
Leicester sewage farm since the land has received regular
dressings of sewage. When I was engaged in laying it
out in 1888 my powers of locomotion over the land were
greatly impeded during wet seasons by the inordinate
amount of clay that adhered to the boots; but when
engaged again for some considerable time on the land
during the winter 1900 to 1901 this unpleasant peculiarity
had completely disappeared even on land that had
recently been sewaged. Through the action of the
sewage the very dense clay had been disintegrated and
become so pliable that, when trod upon, it crumbled to
pieces. The colour of the soil had been changed from a
yellowish-brown to a greyish-black, and altogether the
land had been greatly improved by the application of
the sewage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Movement of liquid through the passage and capillary zones to the impervious layer.</div>
<p><!--066.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 58]</span>
If more sewage is poured upon the land than the
effluent drains can deal with&mdash;and here it may be well to
bear in mind that on sewage farms in our climate on a
broad average throughout the year about one-third of
the total quantity is lost by evaporation&mdash;the excess
will pass down between the drains from the evaporation
to the passage zone, and if the flow of the sewage is not
discontinued the downward movement in the passage
zone may be continued until, after having traversed the
capillary zone, the level of the subsoil water is reached.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Length of downward movement of water may be very great.</div>
<p class="pb">What length of time may elapse before this level is
reached will entirely depend on local circumstances, but
it will be clear from the preliminary remarks that the
completion of this downward movement may in places
and under certain conditions take a very long time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Displacement of sewage held by the pores of the land by the fresh discharge of sewage upon the surface of the land.</div>
<p class="pb">In connection with this it is of importance to point out
that not the fresh sewage which is poured on the surface
of the land will at once pass into the lower layers, but a
portion of the old sewage, which up to then was stored in
the pores and is now displaced by the fresh discharge, so
that the fresh raw sewage is retained and only purified
sewage allowed to escape into deeper layers, which
means that in its downward movement all sewage
undergoes purification. Were this not the case the
raw sewage might reach the effluent drains.</p>

<p>It appears time now to examine somewhat more
closely the processes of decomposition and the products
elaborated therein.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Factors that influence the process of decomposition.</div>
<p class="pb">Concerning the factors which have a favourable
influence upon this process, some of them, such as
permeability for air, high retentive and absorbing powers,
have already been mentioned, and to these can be added
moisture and warmth, the latter of which are always
present in sewage.</p>

<p><!--067.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Advantages of a systematic underdrainage.</div>
<p>One word here concerning the systematic under-drainage
of the subsoil. Its chief function is, of course,
the carrying away of the effluent water and by doing so
to prevent the formation of a swamp, but after the land
has done its work, and during so-called periods of rest,
the under-drains act as ventilators of the subsoil and thus
make it artificially more permeable for air, with the
result that a drying-up action is set up and oxygen
supplied for micro-organic life. For the purpose of
improving the ventilation of the soil it may become
advisable in places to connect the upper ends of the
drains with a short upcast shaft. The mouths of the
drains should always discharge above water so as to
allow of a free circulation of air.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Micro-organisms that carry on the work of splitting up and converting organic compounds.</div>
<p class="pb4">The work of splitting up and converting the organic
compounds is primarily carried out by micro-organisms
such as yeast fungi, mould fungi, algæ, protozoa and
even by higher forms of life such as earthworms and
insects.</p>

<p>To what extent in addition to these other agencies
take part in this bio-chemical process is not yet fully
elucidated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decomposition and putrefaction most complicated processes.</div>
<p>Fischer in his interesting book, ‘The Structure and
Functions of Bacteria,’ observes (page 99): “The
decomposition of dead animal bodies, of vegetable
tissues, or of substances like stable manure, is far from
being a simple putrefactive process. Side by side with
the disintegration of nitrogenous bodies there are going
on a number of fermentative changes by which non-nitrogenous
compounds are being broken up, besides
nitrification and other bio-chemical processes. For this
reason it is always difficult and often impossible to
determine the respective parts played by the different
species of bacteria.…</p>

<p><!--068.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 60]</span>
“The phenomena of putrefaction are so complicated
that we do not know all of the compounds that arise
during the process.… Very careful chemical investigations
on pure cultures will be necessary before the
chaos of phenomena presented by putrefactive bacteria
can be arranged in something like order.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In the decomposition of proteids five or rather six stages may be distinguished.</div>
<p class="pb">"Proteids are split up by putrefaction into a large
number of simpler compounds both nitrogenous and
non-nitrogenous. The substances thus produced are
precisely similar to those resulting from the artificial
decomposition of proteids by fusion with caustic potash
or boiling with hydrochloric acid or barium hydrate.
Five groups may be distinguished:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Albumoses and peptones.</div>
<p>"1. Albumoses and peptones: soluble diffusible
bodies closely resembling albumen. They are produced
by the action on albumen of bacterial enzymes, similar
to the enzymes (pepsin and pancreatin) which give
rise to peptones in the digestive tract of man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aromatic compounds.</div>
<p>"2. Aromatic compounds; among others indol and
skatol, which give the characteristic odour to human
excrement; also some non-nitrogenous substances such
as phenol, phenylacetic acid, and phenylpropionic acid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Amido compounds.</div>
<p>"3. Amido compounds, all nitrogenous: leucin, tyrosin,
aspartic acid, glycocol.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fatty and aromatic acids.</div>
<p>"4. Fatty and aromatic acids, all non-nitrogenous and
therefore having no part in the circulation of nitrogen;
acetic, butyric, succinic and valerianic acids.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inorganic end-products of putrefaction.</div>
<p>"5. Inorganic end-products of putrefaction: free
nitrogen, ammonia, free hydrogen, methane, carbonic
acid, methylmercaptan, sulphuretted hydrogen. It is
probable also, but not certain, that phosphuretted
hydrogen is formed and is oxidised at once by the free
oxygen of the atmosphere.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ptomaines.</div>
<p>"Most of these substances are formed also by the
<!--069.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 61]</span>
chemical decomposition of proteids, but there is a sixth
group which may be termed specific putrefactive products.
These are the so-called ptomaines or putrefactive
alkaloids.”</p>

<p>Some of these bodies are either not poisonous or
only poisonous in large doses, whilst others, derived
from putrid foods of various kinds (sausages, cheese), are
highly toxic (ptomatropine, tyrotoxine).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Definition of some terms.</div>
<p>Concerning the work done by micro-organisms, it
may not be out of place here to define the meaning of
certain terms, and to direct attention at the same time
to the modifications in the results brought about by the
presence or absence of air during the various stages of
the process.</p>

<p>The terms mineralisation, disintegration, oxidation,
hydrolysis, bacteriolysis, nitrification, decomposition,
eremacausis, putrefaction, fermentation, etc., have by
many been used somewhat promiscuously, and this has
led to a good deal of confusion, bewilderment and misconception.
The cause of this has been undoubtedly
our small amount of knowledge concerning this process
and the changes brought about therein, but this would
appear to be no reason why complication should be
made worse. For the purposes of these remarks the
undermentioned terms shall have the following meaning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mineralisation.</div>
<p>The term “mineralisation” is used for describing
the whole process of the disintegration and conversion
of organic into mineral matter, and no distinction shall
be made between organic matter containing nitrogenous
and organic matter containing carbonaceous substances.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aerobic fermentation or decomposition.</div>
<p class="pb">When this process of mineralisation is carried on in
the presence of sufficient quantities of air it is called
“aerobic fermentation,” or “decomposition,” which is
generally characterised by the absence of strong smells.
<!--070.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 62]</span>
The process may then be called one of complete oxidation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Anaerobic fermentation or putrefaction.</div>
<p class="pb">Where, however, the mineralisation proceeds in the
absence of air the process is called “anaerobic fermentation,”
or “putrefaction,” and it is then that very
pronounced foul smells are emitted. The process may
then be called one of incomplete oxidation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Obligatory aerobes and anaerobes.<br /><br />
Facultative anaerobes.</div>
<p class="pb">That class of micro-organisms which can only live in
the presence of oxygen is called “obligatory aerobes,”
and that which can only exist in the absence of this gas
“obligatory anaerobes.”
Between these two is the group
of “facultative anaerobes,” which, while growing best
with a plentiful supply of oxygen, are nevertheless able
to exist with a very small amount, and even with none
at all, although in this case their vitality is often much
impaired.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Organic matters are first split up and then converted into mineral substances.</div>
<p class="pb">In the process of mineralisation two stages may be
distinguished, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> the first or disintegration stage, and
the second or oxidation stage, i.e. the organic substances
are first split up and afterwards converted into inorganic
ones; and frequently these processes are taking place
side by side and not after each other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The splitting up of organic substances is frequently carried out in the presence of air.</div>
<p class="pb">It has been maintained&mdash;probably with a view to
justifying the necessity of a septic tank&mdash;that the preliminary
process of splitting up is best carried out in
the absence of oxygen, but sufficient proof does not
appear to have been advanced in support of this statement,
and in some cases at any rate it is evidently
carried out quite satisfactorily in the presence of air.</p>

<p>Concerning the presence or absence of oxygen,
Fischer observes as follows:&mdash;&#8203;</p>

<p class="blockquote">"The effects of the presence of oxygen are somewhat
better understood. If air have free access, putrefaction
(decomposition) may go on without any odour at
<!--071.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 63]</span>
all, the evil-smelling gases (NH<sub>3</sub> and SH<sub>2</sub>, for example)
being oxidised at once to form nitrates and sulphates.
Aerobic bacteria, too, such as the nitre and sulphur
bacteria, bring about this mineralisation of organic nitrogen.
Moreover, when air is circulating freely, there is
no accumulation of intermediate products such as skatol
or indol. It occurs on the surface of manure heaps, on
the outer surfaces of carcases, and in well ventilated
soil.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"In anaerobic decomposition (putrefaction proper),
as in anaerobic fermentation, the organic molecules are
at first only partly disintegrated, intermediate products
such as leucine, tyrosine, skatol and indol being formed.
In the absence of air these accumulate, and hence it is
that putrefaction going on in the mud of ponds and
ditches, or inside carcases, is accompanied by such evil
odours.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"Although the details of the process vary considerably,
according to the presence or absence of air, the
ultimate products of decomposition and putrefaction are
in both cases the same: namely, free nitrogen, free
hydrogen, ammonia, methane, carbonic acid and sulphuretted
hydrogen. These are also the end-results of the
disintegration of the human body.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"After the organic nitrogen of decomposing substances
has been converted into ammonia, and to a
small extent into free nitrogen, the latter can at once be
utilised by the root-nodule organisms and other bacteria
in the soil, but the ammonia must undergo two further
changes and combine with a base to form a nitric salt
before it is available for plant life. These two changes
are brought about by bacteria, which convert the
ammonia first into nitrous and then into nitric acid; this
process has been called ‘nitrification.’”</p>

<p><!--072.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 64]</span>
It will be clear from the foregoing remarks that the
process of mineralisation is a very complicated one,
which under favourable conditions, for instance in the
pores of an open soil, may come to an end fairly quickly,
but which under very unfavourable conditions&mdash;such as
the interior of large heaps of refuse&mdash;may last many
years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chemical purification on sewage farms.</div>
<p>Concerning the chemical purification effected on
sewage farms, i.e. the purification of the sewage as
revealed by chemical analysis, it has been put on record
over and over again, and is now fully and universally
understood, that suitable land well managed is capable
of changing even the foulest sewage to a perfectly clear
water devoid of smell and danger, so that this point need
not be laboured here. For instance, on the Berlin
sewage farms the degree of purification attained has
averaged for a period of 20 years 97 per cent., and on the
farm at Gennevilliers&mdash;one of the Paris sewage farms&mdash;the
effluent is so sparkling, bright and clear that the
inhabitants drink it in preference to other available
water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Micro-organic purity of effluent from sewage farms.</div>
<p class="pb">But in reference to the purity of the effluent as to
the products of micro-organic activity and pathogenic
micro-organisms, it will be necessary to make a few
observations with a view to remove misconceptions that
have from time to time been put forward.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ptomaines have not been found in effluents from well managed sewage farms.</div>
<p>The question whether the specific products of
putrefaction, i.e. the putrefactive alkaloids “ptomaines
and toxines,” are capable of doing further mischief by
escaping with the effluent into the stream, may be
answered as follows. These substances are fortunately
very unstable, and the experiments conducted by Falk
and others seem further to indicate that soil is capable
of retaining them and of rendering them harmless. At
<!--073.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 65]</span>
any rate there is no well authenticated case on record
of these bodies having wrought mischief on sewage
farms. (See here also the remarks made on pages
51 and 52 under the heading “The Absorbing Powers
of Soil.")</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pathogenic germs on sewage farms.</div>
<p>It has further been maintained that the presence of
pathogenic organisms on sewage farms might in two
ways lead to mischief, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> either by transmission through
air or by transmission through water. The pathogenic
organisms after spreading over the land might rise into
the air through the movements of the atmosphere and
then be carried about by it, or they might escape through
the land and be conveyed with the effluent into the
stream or river that takes the latter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pasteur’s fears as to mischief likely to be brought about by pathogenic micro-organisms on sewage farms not borne out by facts.</div>
<p class="pb">In connection with this point it may not be without
interest to mention here that even the late M. Pasteur at
one time of his career considered the wholesale spreading
of disease germs on sewage farms might prove highly
injurious to the public health of the neighbourhood. As
he himself admitted, he based his fears on purely
theoretical considerations and opposed, for this reason,
the extension of the sewage farms in the neighbourhood
of Paris. But when, later on, he was made acquainted
with the results observed on the Berlin farms, he tacitly
modified his views and ceased to oppose the extension
of the Paris farms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No well-authenticated case is on record where a sewage farm has acted as the focus of a local outbreak of typhoid fever.</div>
<p class="pb4">Indeed, search as I might, I have not been able to
discover one single instance where a sewage farm has
acted as the focus of a local outbreak. On the
contrary, during one or two small epidemics of typhoid
fever in Berlin, no case of this complaint has been observed
on the sewage farms of that city.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Experience on the Berlin farms.</div>
<p>Concerning the escape of pathogenic micro-organisms
into streams and rivers, no case is on record where such
<!--074.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 66]</span>
a thing has actually occurred: indeed, the very painstaking
investigations on the Berlin farms have led to
negative results.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Observations made at the Freiburg sewage farm.</div>
<p>Another sewage farm, that of Freiburg in Baden, has
likewise been made the subject of careful and long-continued
investigation by Dr. Korn, who, for the twelve
months ending August 1897, made no less than 165
elaborate chemical and bacteriological examinations.
Summing up his observations on the presence of bacteria
in the effluents from subsoil drains, he remarks:</p>

<p class="blockquote">"Apart from the few exceptional cases of high
numbers, generally speaking my experiments show that
the number of germs in the subsoil drain effluents is
relatively small, and even omitting these experiments, in
which a dilution with subsoil water must have taken
place, the number of micro-organisms is still so small
that the effects of filtration through soil are clearly
perceptible. In addition to this&mdash;and this is of considerable
importance in forming a judgment&mdash;it must
be borne in mind that the bacteria in sewage are
principally derived from the intestines, whereas in the
subsoil drain effluents the inhabitants of the intestines
are either not present at all or only in very small
numbers compared with the number of soil and water
bacteria, which are always present. Out of 165
examinations I only succeeded in 18 cases in proving
the presence of bacterium coli.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bacterium coli no longer a true criterion of sewage pollution.</div>
<p class="pb">It may be convenient to point out in this place that
bacterium coli can no longer be looked upon as a typical
inhabitant of the human intestines after the very
elaborate investigations carried out by Dr. Weissenfels,
who arrived at the following conclusions:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dr. Weissenfels’ conclusions.</div>
<p>1. The so-called bacterium coli can be cultivated
from almost every kind of water, and its presence can be
<!--075.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 67]</span>
demonstrated in nearly every case, provided a sufficient
volume of water is utilised.</p>

<p>2. It is not possible by the result of the experiments
upon animals to decide whether the bacterium coli was
cultivated from a pure or infected water, and the
discovery of a virulent bacterium coli in any sample of
water cannot, therefore, be regarded as a criterion that
such water has been polluted with fæcal bacteria.</p>

<p>After these remarks, it would seem quite possible
that the bacterium coli discovered in eighteen cases by
Dr. Korn in the Freiburg effluents was not derived from
sewage at all but from the ordinary subsoil water of the
land.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The possibility of further mischief by pathogenic micro-organisms on sewage farms is exceedingly remote, if it exists at all.</div>
<p class="pb3">Bearing these observations in mind, it is quite clear,
therefore, that neither theoretical investigations, as available
up to now, nor practical results, support the theory
that pathogenic micro-organisms may do mischief on
sewage farms, and one is forced to conclude that this
possibility&mdash;if it exists at all&mdash;after systematic treatment
on land is an exceedingly remote one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sewage farms reduce the quantity of final effluent.</div>
<p>Before concluding these remarks on the natural
purification of sewage it is necessary to draw attention
to another considerable advantage which it possesses
over artificial sewage treatments, and that is the reduction
in quantity of the effluent, which at times is very
considerable, whereas in the artificial methods such a
reduction is comparatively small.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Loss of liquid by evaporation and by plant life.</div>
<p>Spread over a large area of land, well cropped, evaporation
is very active&mdash;especially during the summer months,
when the flow of water in the brook that takes the
effluent is as a rule at its lowest; and, in addition to this,
the growing plants further abstract a considerable amount
of the liquid that finds its way into the soil, so that the
quantity of the effluent may not be more than from 30
<!--076.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 68]</span>
to 50 per cent. of the total quantity that was poured
over the land. In the artificial treatment the evaporation
is considerably smaller, and as plants are altogether
absent the quantity of the effluent is probably about
90 per cent. and more of the total quantity of the raw
sewage. This is a point of very considerable importance
so far as the influence of the effluent upon the water in
the stream that takes the same is concerned.</p>

<p>Although the subject of natural purification is by no
means exhausted, it is now time to direct attention to
artificial methods.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Experiments have not been conducted on uniform lines.</div>
<p>A casual observer might, therefore, consider himself
justified in thinking that all these experiments had added
a great deal to our knowledge of the intricate changes
taking place in these processes, but such a conclusion
would not be justified in reality. For beyond settling
questions of local importance by chemical analysis,
the experiments, owing to a variety of causes, have not
<!--077.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 69]</span>
materially enhanced the stores of our information, indeed
not unfrequently the results obtained are apparently contradictory
and bewildering.</p>

<p>An experiment must be looked upon as a question
addressed to nature, and the answer will depend on the
way the question has been put. If this way differs in
every case it must be clear that the answer, too, will differ
in every case, and it is this absence of uniformity which
greatly reduces the general value of these experiments.</p>

<p>These remarks must not be misunderstood to convey
the impression as if the experiments had not been conducted
with care and skill! Far from it! Some of them
have been made with the greatest skill and care and with
the very evident desire to arrive at correct conclusions,
and it is only when they are placed side by side with
other experiments, with a view to deducing from them
general conclusions concerning the processes at work,
that great difficulties are experienced. The result of
each experiment is governed by a large number of
factors, which by slightly different manipulations may
attain in this ever-fluctuating process different weights,
so that the results may be contradictory, and it is only
by arranging these factors on a common basis, as it were,
and by addressing the questions to nature in the same
systematic and uniform way, that good general results
may be expected.</p>

<p>It is well known, for instance, that in some cases
septic tanks have not given good results, whilst in others
they have worked very well; again, continuous filtration
has failed in some experiments, whilst in others, notably
in the York experiments, it has given good results.</p>

<p>If, therefore, in future the mistake of the past is to be
avoided, it will be necessary to settle on a common line
of action in all experiments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempt to evolve general theory.</div>
<p><!--078.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 70]</span>
In spite of all the difficulties which beset such a task,
an attempt will be made in the following observations
to evolve some general theory concerning the processes
at work in the artificial self-purification of sewage.
Such a theory, it is quite clear, cannot be complete in
the present state of our knowledge, and it is sincerely
hoped that the many and serious gaps will be filled up
by later investigations.</p>

<p>For convenience of reference the different forms of the
process, such as are now employed, shall be dealt with
separately, commencing with contact or oxidation beds.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">2. Artificial Self-Purification of Sewage
in Intermittent Contact Beds.</span></p>

<p>At the outset it may not be out of place to make a
few remarks concerning the various names given to this
form of application. The term “intermittent contact
bed” is here used to distinguish this kind of bed from
the “continuous contact bed,” frequently called “continuous
filtration.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Names of process misleading.</div>
<p><a name="process" id="process"></a>
(<span class="subsection">a</span>) <span class="title">Name of Process.</span>&mdash;This process has frequently
been called “biological process,” “bacteriological process,”
“contact bed system” or “oxidation bed system,”
but all these terms do not appear to define it sufficiently,
as they do not cover the whole, but only phases or
stages in the same; hence, they do not seem appropriate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Biological process.</div>
<p>The name “biological process” is decidedly misleading,
for besides biological agencies there are also
at work physical (mechanical) and chemical ones.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bacteriological process.</div>
<p>The term “bacteriological or bacterial process” is
likewise erroneous, for besides bacteria a number of
other micro-organisms participate in it&mdash;such as yeast
<!--079.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 71]</span>
fungi, mould fungi, algæ, protozoa, and even higher
forms of life, such as earthworms and insects.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contact bed system.<br /><br />
Oxidation bed system.</div>
<p class="pb">The expressions “contact bed system” or “oxidation
bed system” are in so far inappropriate as they describe
only portions of the process but not the whole.
The term “contact bed” describes the first stage, and the
term “oxidation bed” portion of the second stage only.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Term most suitable.</div>
<p>The term which seems most suitable of all is “artificial
self-purification in contact beds,” as it includes
every phase of this lengthy process applied in an artificial
form; the term “natural self-purification” being applied
to land treatment of sewage, as it is the only method in
which the self-purifying powers are employed under
natural conditions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Working operations.</div>
<p><a name="explan" id="explan"></a>
(<span class="subsection">b</span>) <span class="title">Explanation of Process.</span>&mdash;The cycle of operations
commences with the filling of the bed, and during the
same the sewage comes gradually in contact with the
filling material. When the bed is full, the inflow is
stopped and the sewage allowed to remain in contact
with the material for some time. The bed is then
emptied, and a period of rest is given it before the
filling is commenced again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Purification of sewage in full bed due to
absorbing powers of filling material and only to a small extent due to
activity of micro-organisms.</div>
<p class="pb">It has been held, that while the sewage is in the
contact bed it undergoes a very rapid process of decomposition
by bacteria, but it must be evident, that as the
sewage&mdash;including filling&mdash;remains only for about two
hours in the bed, the micro-organisms would have to
work at an express rate. This fact alone is apt to make
this theory very doubtful, but apart from it, it has been
proved by experiments that the by far greater amount
of purification&mdash;whilst the sewage is in the beds&mdash;is due
to the absorbing powers of the filling material, which
are derived from the surface attraction of its component
particles.</p>

<p><!--080.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Retention of suspended matters by bed.<br /><br />
Absorbing powers of filling material.</div>
<p class="pb">The filling material retains in its upper layers the
suspended matters, which it strains out of the sewage
in a purely mechanical manner, much after the fashion of
a screen, and when the bed is filled its absorbing powers
come into play,
which cause the removal of the dissolved
matters out of the liquid and their retention on the surface
of the particles. This latter process is probably a
chemico-physical one assisted by the micro-organic life
in the sewage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decomposition of organic substances by micro-organisms when bed is empty.</div>
<p>It is only after the bed has been emptied that the
real activity of the vast number of micro-organisms
commences, which is directed towards converting the
organic substances into mineral ones. This process of
splitting up, decomposing, disintegrating and mineralising
organic waste products is an exceedingly complex
one, which ever fluctuates according to the prevailing
conditions, and which does not come to an end until
finally stable mineral forms are reached. In the presence
of a plentiful supply of oxygen, the process proceeds as
a rule at a more rapid rate, and the intermediate forms
produced are less complex than in the comparative or
total absence of this gas; hence the progress of the
process is largely determined by it. The amount of
oxygen necessary for bacterial activity is partly abstracted,
and with extraordinary energy, from the atmospheric
air in the pores of the filling material, and a
portion of the substances formed, such as carbonic acid
and nitrogen&mdash;in gas form&mdash;escape into the atmosphere,
whilst the remaining portions are washed out of the bed
with other products, such as nitric acid, by the effluent.</p>

<p>Further remarks upon this process of mineralisation
have been made in connection with the subject of natural
self-purification of sewage, and these may be referred to
here.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effluent from bed practically raw sewage as far as its bacterial contents are concerned.</div>
<p class="pb3"><!--081.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 73]</span>
The effect of the bed upon the bacterial flora of
sewage is, as was to be expected, but very slight, and it
is on record now that, as far as the micro-organic life is
concerned, the effluent is to all intents and purposes raw
sewage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Silting up of bed.</div>
<p>Some of the substances contained in raw sewage
remain in the bed, no matter how carefully the sewage
has been previously strained, and these, in combination
with the slimy surface coating of the component particles,
the accumulation of mineralised substances in the pores,
the consolidation of the bed, the disintegration of the
filling material, and the liquid retained, lead gradually
but surely to the silting or sludging up of the bed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Theoretical original water capacity of bed.</div>
<p><a name="bed" id="bed"></a>
(<span class="subsection">c</span>) <span class="title">Water Capacity of Bed and Silting up.</span>&mdash;The
theoretical water capacity of the bed, previous to commencing
operations, is the aggregate of the cubical space
occupied by the pores or small passages between the
particles forming the filling material, and the pores of
the filling material itself; but in practice a certain amount
of this space is occupied by air, which it is impossible to
dislodge altogether in filling. The aggregate of the
cubical space of the pores may be called the pore-volume.</p>

<p>It is difficult to lay down general rules as to what the
original water capacity of a bed should be expressed in
per cent. of the space occupied by the filling material,
but speaking within fairly wide limits the following is
somewhat near the truth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Original water capacity with spherical particles of uniform size.</div>
<p class="pb">When the particles forming the filling material are
fairly spherical and of equal size, the original water
capacity of a bed amounts to about 38 per cent. of the
space occupied by the filling material; but as in practice
it is difficult to obtain spherical particles of uniform size,
the original water capacity is found to range from 35 to
45 per cent. of this space.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Original water capacity with particles of different sizes.</div>
<p class="pb"><!--082.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 74]</span>
When, however, the particles are of materially
different sizes, and when the smaller ones fill up the
spaces between the larger ones, the original water
capacity may sink down to as low as from 5 to 10 per
cent. of the space occupied by the filling material.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Size of particles of filling material does, under certain conditions, not affect original water capacity of bed.</div>
<p class="pb">It has been further demonstrated that the water
capacity of a bed is not affected by the size of the
particles, provided the latter are spherical and of uniform
size. In other words, the water capacity of two beds
filled with material of different sizes is the same, provided
the particles are spherical and of uniform size throughout
each bed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Silting up of bed during regular work.<br /><br />
Rapid initial decrease of capacity.<br /><br />
Consolidation of bed.</div>
<p class="pb3">This original water capacity is, however, not maintained
in regular work, as has been pointed out already.
Basing the observations on regular work only, the
original capacity decreases at first, after a new bed has
been started or after an old reconstructed bed has been
taken in hand, rapidly for some time and afterwards
more slowly. Graphically expressed, this decrease is not
represented by a straight line but approaches more
nearly a parabolic curve.
This initial rapid decrease is
chiefly due to the consolidation of the bed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disintegration of filling material.</div>
<p>In connection with the movements in the bed tending
towards its consolidation, it is also clear that the
continual filling and emptying operations cause the
smaller particles to be washed out of their original
position and to be placed in the larger passages between
the filling material, and if this process is assisted by the
gradual disintegration of the particles composing the
filling material, it is clear that the pores must become
smaller and smaller in time, i.e. choked.</p>

<p>From these observations it follows that the filling
material should be a hard substance, which will only to a
limited extent be subject to this crumbling away process.</p>

<p><!--083.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 75]</span>
But besides these there are, as has already been
pointed out, other silting up agencies at work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Water-retentive power of filling material.</div>
<p class="pb">Of the total quantity of sewage which has entered
the bed a small portion will always remain in it owing to
the water retaining power of the material. This power
has sometimes been called “minimum water capacity,”
but as this name is liable to be misunderstood, it is
better to adopt here the term “water-retentive power”
of material.</p>

<p>The quantity of the sewage retained by the bed
varies with the material and pore-volume, and is due
to adhesion and capillary attraction. The greater the
pore-volume, and the greater the percentage of fine pores,
the greater is the quantity thus retained. Clean gravel
retains about 12 per cent. and fine sand about 84 per
cent. of its water capacity&mdash;i.e. expressed per cubic yard
of filling material, one cubic yard of clean gravel will
retain about 10 gallons and one cubic yard of fine sand
about 70 gallons of water.</p>

<p>Through draining a bed for several hours through
evaporation and other atmospheric influence, a portion
of the sewage retained is lost, but the quantity so lost
will vary continually with the circumstances under which
the bed is worked.</p>

<p>The water-retentive power of the filling material does
not decrease with the working of the bed, but increases,
which in a large measure is probably due to the slimy
coat which forms round the surface of the component
particles, and to which reference is made in the following
paragraph.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Slimy surface coating of component particles.</div>
<p>A further silting-up agency is the slimy surface
coating of the particles of the filling material. This
accumulation is well known to all who have had to do
with intermittent contact beds, and has been described as
<!--084.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 76]</span>
spongy bacterial growth. The Manchester report for
the year ending March 27, 1901, contains on page 62 the
following passage: “This (spongy bacterial growth) is
at once the cause of increased efficiency in the bed and
loss of capacity. On examining the material of a
contact bed in active condition, every piece is seen to be
coated over with a slimy growth. If this is removed it
soon dries to a stiff jelly, which can be cut with a knife.
Under the microscope masses of bacteria and zoogloea
will be found to be present.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Accumulations of decomposed substances in the pores.</div>
<p>In addition to this slimy surface-coating of the
particles, there are also found in the pores, especially in
the upper layers of the filling material&mdash;and in fine beds
more so than in a coarse bed&mdash;accumulations which are
“akin to humus or garden soil.” They contain to a
limited extent only putrescible substances, and appear to
be the remains of organic matter decomposed by the
activity of micro-organisms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Periods of rest will not permanently restore portion of the original water capacity of the bed.</div>
<p class="pb">It was formerly maintained with considerable persistency
that periods of rest would permanently restore to
a systematically worked bed a portion of its lost water
capacity, but such a contention has been proved to be
wrong. It is quite true that immediately after periods
of rest an increase of the water capacity is very noticeable,
which is probably due to drying up processes
within the bed during the rest, but such an increase is
not permanent and is lost again more or less quickly; it
is therefore only temporary and not permanent.</p>

<p>Where, however, a bed has not been systematically
worked, i.e. where it has been worked at a greater rate
than is suitable, and where in consequence of this a
large quantity of undecomposed substances is stored in
it, a period of rest may permanently restore a portion of
the lost capacity; but this is due to the mineralisation
<!--085.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 77]</span>
of these undecomposed organic substances during the
rest.</p>

<p>It follows from these remarks, as has been stated
above, that when the organic substances are regularly decomposed
during systematic work a period of rest cannot
materially affect the water capacity, and that where
a considerable permanent restoration of the water
capacity takes place the bed has not been properly
worked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decrease of capacity is accompanied to some extent by increase of efficiency and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</i>.</div>
<p class="pb3">It would, however, be incorrect to assume that the
silting up of the bed affects its efficiency besides reducing
the capacity. On the contrary! To some extent
decrease of capacity is accompanied by increase of
efficiency and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</i>!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Higher capacity of beds in summer than in winter.</div>
<p class="pb">At this point it ought to be stated that in the Manchester
experiments (see page 61 of the report for the
year ending 27th March, 1901) a higher average capacity
is maintained during the summer than during the
winter, which is no doubt due to the greater activity of
the micro-organisms during the warm weather of the
year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Raking of beds not advantageous.</div>
<p class="pb">The raking of the surface does not materially affect
the capacity of the bed, and it is better to scrape off the
matters retained on the surface than to rake them into
the body of the bed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Renovation of filling material either partially or wholly.</div>
<p>It will be clear from these observations that, no
matter how carefully the bed has been worked, sooner
or later a time will come when the decrease of capacity
becomes so pronounced as to render it impossible any
longer to treat the daily flow of sewage with the available
plant; and when this point has been reached a renovation,
either partially or wholly, of the filling material
becomes an inevitable necessity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Minimum capacity of beds to be provided for.</div>
<p class="pb">To provide for this at the outset, and thus avoid the
<!--086.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 78]</span>
difficulties of reduced capacity, it seems advisable to lay
down, when designing the works, a minimum capacity,
which will just allow the daily volume of sewage to be
treated by the plant, and which when reached will
necessitate the cleansing of the bed.</p>

<p>The idea, formerly frequently expressed, that the
filling material when rationally worked need not be renewed
or renovated, can no longer be maintained and is
outside the reach of practical possibilities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Underdrainage of intermittent contact beds.</div>
<p>At this place a word or two about the under drainage
of intermittent contact beds may not be out of place.
It is of the greatest importance that all drains should
work well, and that the entrance of the sewage into
them should not lead to disturbance in the filling
material, especially should the tearing of portions of the
filling material into the drain pipes be avoided.</p>

<p>By carefully arranging the position, number, size and
fall of the master drains and branch drains, it is possible
to reduce the resistance so as to allow of a fairly even
flow of sewage through all the drains, and to prevent a
great rush of water through the drains near the outlet
end.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The presence of lime is of no consequence.</div>
<p class="pb">In passing it may not be out of place to point out
that the view, formerly expressed, that an admixture of
lime in some form would prove advantageous to the
purification of sewage, is not supported by the experience
gained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Absorbing effect increases with the time of contact.</div>
<p class="pb3"><a name="filling" id="filling"></a>
(<span class="subsection">d</span>) <span class="title">Absorbing Powers of Filling Material.</span>&mdash;The absorbing
effect of any filling material seems to increase
with the time of contact.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Absorbing powers increase until bed has become ripe.</div>
<p class="pb">It ought further to be pointed out that the absorbing
powers of the filling material gradually increase until the
bed has become ripe. This fact was formerly stated to
be due to the development of the proper micro-organisms
<!--087.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 79]</span>
within the bed, but it would seem to be chiefly due to
the slimy surface coating of the particles of the filling
material, or spongy bacterial growth, as it has frequently
been called, which does not only assist mechanical filtration
but also possesses high powers of absorbing
oxygen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Absorbing powers soon cease in the absence of micro-organisms and air.</div>
<p class="pb">But it cannot be open to doubt that the absorbing
powers of the filling material are dependent in some way
or other on the presence of micro-organisms, for Dunbar
has shown that in the absence of micro-organisms and
without periods of aeration these powers soon cease.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oxygen is absorbed from air in the pores with great energy.</div>
<p class="pb"><a name="oxyg" id="oxyg"></a>
(<span class="subsection">e</span>) <span class="title">Consumption of Oxygen by the Filling Material.</span>&mdash;The
oxygen necessary for the proper work of an intermittent
contact bed is abstracted with great energy from
the atmospheric air, with which the pores become filled
during periods of rest. Through diffusion, and through
the vacuum created by the processes of absorption,
further quantities of oxygen are taken from the atmospheric
air, even under difficult conditions, and, as pointed
out in the Manchester report for the year ending 27th
March, 1901, “there is, therefore, little need to force air
into a bed.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The oxygen taken up during aeration is not imparted to the sewage at the next filling and does not escape in the effluent.</div>
<p class="pb3">The oxygen thus taken up is not imparted in gas form
to the sewage during the next filling, and the effluents
from intermittent contact beds are not saturated with
oxygen. Dunbar states that the effluents of a satisfactorily
worked bed frequently only contain one cubic
centimetre of free oxygen per litre. Clowes reports a
similar result in his third report on the London experiments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The greatest quantity of oxygen is consumed during the oxidation of the products formed by micro-organisms.</div>
<p class="pb8">There can be no doubt that by far the greatest
quantity of oxygen is consumed during the process of
oxidation of the products formed by micro-organisms
from putrescible organic substances.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Consumption of oxygen and formation of carbonic acid not solely due to biological agencies.</div>
<p class="pb"><!--088.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 80]</span>
<a name="carbonic" id="carbonic"></a>
(<span class="subsection">f</span>) <span class="title">Formation of Carbonic Acid.</span>&mdash;Dunbar has shown
by his experiments that the consumption of oxygen
and the formation of carbonic acid is not solely due to
biological agencies, but is to some extent the result of
physico-chemical processes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">More free carbonic acid contained in the effluent than in the raw sewage.<br /><br />
By far the greatest portion of carbonic acid escapes into the air.</div>
<p class="pb3">He further reports that in his experiments the effluents
contained on an average 100 milligram per litre more free
carbonic acid than the raw sewage, and that the quantity
contained in the effluents represents only a small portion
of the total amount of carbonic acid formed during the
whole process. The by far greatest portion of carbonic
acid escapes into the air. Concerning the air in the pores
of the filling material during periods of aeration, Dunbar
states that it contains sometimes not less than from 6 to
10 per cent. carbonic acid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nitrogen escapes in gas form into the air.</div>
<p><a name="nitro" id="nitro"></a>
(<span class="subsection">g</span>) <span class="title">Nitrogen.</span>&mdash;It is quite clear from all experiments
that a considerable amount of the total nitrogen contained
in raw sewage is abstracted by the filling material
of intermittent contact beds, and it is interesting to ascertain
what becomes of it! Does it accumulate in the bed?
In that case, one has a right to assume that the satisfactory
work of the bed would gradually cease! As this
is, however, not the case, and as, further, the sludge
formed in the bed, whether it be fairly fresh or very stale,
only contains a very small amount of total nitrogen, we
must surmise that the nitrogen after its retention by the
bed escapes in gas form&mdash;like the carbonic acid&mdash;into the
atmosphere.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The presence of nitric acid is not an unfailing guide for determining the satisfactory character of the effluent.</div>
<p class="pb3"><a name="nitric" id="nitric"></a>
(<span class="subsection">h</span>) <span class="title">The Formation of Nitric Acid.</span>&mdash;Concerning the
presence of nitric acid in the effluents from intermittent
contact beds, Dunbar is of opinion that it offers certain
means for forming an opinion of the processes taking
place in the same, but that it is only in a subordinate
sense an indication of the degree of purification attained
<!--089.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 81]</span>
and must not be taken as an unfailing guide for determining
the satisfactory character of the effluent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nitrifying bacteria always present in town’s sewage.<br /><br />
Nitric acid is formed very rapidly, but only during periods of rest.</div>
<p class="pb6">Nitrifying bacteria are always present in ordinary
town’s sewage, but it would appear that other micro-organisms
besides Winogradsky’s bacteria assist in the
process of nitrification.
Nitric acid is formed very
rapidly, but only during periods of rest, and besides
aeration other less powerful influences are at work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reduction of nitric acid when bed is filled from bottom with an upward flow.</div>
<p>It is further interesting to note that, according to
Dunbar, the greater portion of nitric acid which has been
formed during periods of aeration becomes completely
reduced in a very short time, when the bed is filled with
an upward flow from the bottom, and that only a small
portion remains in the form of nitrous acid.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">3. Artificial Self-Purification of Sewage
in Septic Tanks.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Septic tanks only used in combination with contact beds.</div>
<p>Although it has never been claimed, and is further
not open to doubt, that a septic tank alone and unaided
by subsequent treatment in intermittent or continuous
contact beds does not sufficiently purify the sewage, in
these remarks the work of the septic tank only will be
considered, as the treatment in contact beds will be dealt

expenditure necessitated by its construction.</p>

<p>It is well known, that at Exeter in the first experimental
installation of this process, the septic tank was
covered in by an arched roof; but subsequent experiments
made elsewhere do not seem to support the theory then
advanced, that such a tank should be a closed one. This
is chiefly due to the thick skin which, after a few months’
work, forms on the surface of closed or open tanks, and
which according to locality and season may reach a
thickness of from 1 to 2 feet; it is maintained then that
this cheap natural cover does away with the expensive
artificial cover.</p>

<p>In the report on the treatment of the Manchester
sewage, by Messrs. Baldwin Latham, Percy F. Frankland
and W. H. Perkin, it is stated on page 54, amongst the
conclusions and recommendations, as follows:&mdash;"The
anaerobic or septic process is found to take place as
effectively in an open tank as in a closed one.” This
conclusion does not appear to have been modified by the
experiments made subsequent to the issue of this report.</p>

<p>In the Leeds experiment a similar result was obtained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Closed septic tanks possess generally speaking no advantages over open ones.</div>
<p class="pb">Whilst it would, therefore, appear to be correct to
say, generally, that closed septic tanks afford no material
advantages over open ones, so far as the purification of
the sewage is concerned, they may become necessary in
special cases, when the smells emanating from open ones
might create nuisances in crowded neighbourhoods.</p>

<p>The following remarks refer, therefore, equally to
open as well as to closed septic tanks, and no distinction
will be made between them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The work in the septic tank is chiefly done by obligatory anaerobes.</div>

(<span class="subsection">c</span>) <span class="title">Explanation of Process.</span>&mdash;Although the processes
taking place in septic tanks are at present but imperfectly
understood, they may be said to be in the main due to
anaerobic micro-organisms, i.e. due to such micro-organisms
which carry on their life’s work in the absence of
oxygen. They split up or peptonise the organic compounds
in the absence of air, and the group of changes
brought about by them has been termed “anaerobic
fermentation” or “putrefaction.” During the same, it
is claimed that a considerable amount of the sludge
retained in the tank is liquefied or destroyed, and that
the rest becomes so changed as to be denser than
ordinary sludge, and to contain less moisture.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dissolved matters entering and leaving the septic tank.</div>
<p class="pb">Concerning the amount and nature of the dissolved
matters entering and leaving an open septic tank, the
following is taken from the Manchester report for the
year ending March 27, 1901:&mdash;&#8203;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Manchester observations.</div>
<p class="blockquote">"A series of determinations have been made of the

similar observations in connection with the closed septic

“A certain amount of loss of ammonia, as ammonium
carbonate, will take place on evaporation in both cases,
and this will probably be greater with septic tank
effluent.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"An examination of the residue obtained by evaporating
large quantities of open septic tank effluent (filtered
through paper), shows that the mineral matters largely
consist of iron oxide, from the decomposition of organic
compounds of iron, and calcium sulphate. Among the
volatile constituents have been detected ammonium
carbonate, mercaptan-like compounds of very offensive
smell, acetic and butyric acids. No evidence of the
presence of amines could be found in the residue on
evaporation, but by distilling large volumes of the liquid
and carefully analysing the platinum salts obtained from
the distillate, the presence of amines is indicated.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"Research in this direction is being continued;
careful comparison especially will be made of the products
obtained by evaporation and distillation of crude
sewage and septic tank effluent respectively.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"The evidence, however, points to a breaking down of
albuminoid and cellulose matter in the septic tank into
simpler and to some extent volatile compounds. The
reactions are probably hydrolytic in character, ammonia,
amines, carbonic acid, water, and possibly alcohol, being
produced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Must aerobic fermentation in all cases be preceded by anaerobic fermentation?</div>
<p>It will be clear from the foregoing, that the changes
going on in a septic tank are entirely different from
those brought about in contact beds, and the question
whether a septic tank is a necessity for the subsequent
contact bed treatment, or whether it is a distinct disadvantage,
can only be definitely settled when we know
<!--093.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 85]</span>
whether aerobic fermentation, i.e. decomposition, must
in all cases be preceded by anaerobic fermentation, i.e.
putrefaction, and to what extent, or whether such a
succession of changes is not necessary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">At Manchester contact beds accustomed to septic tank effluent did not at once purify raw sewage.</div>
<p class="pb3">It is interesting to note in connection with this point,
that during the Manchester experiments it was established
that contact beds, which have become accustomed

fresh sewage.</p>

<p>It seems to have become a habit to express this
velocity by the length of the sojourn of the sewage in
the septic tank&mdash;for instance, “the flow of sewage through
the tank was such that it would fill it in twenty-four
hours"; but as all tanks vary in size, and as in consequence
the distance which has to be traversed by the
sewage from the entrance to the exit in twenty-four
hours is different in nearly every case, such a habit is,
to say the very least, very misleading.</p>

<p>It will not be disputed that the deposition of the
suspended solids in sewage is dependent on the rate of
movement of the liquid, and that in a quickly moving
liquid there will be less deposition than in a very slowly
travelling liquid.</p>

<p>Bearing this in mind it will not be without interest to
examine the velocities employed during the Manchester
<!--094.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 86]</span>
and Leeds experiments. The tanks employed in these
have the dimensions given in the table on the preceding
page.</p>

<p>Now assuming that each tank is to be filled once in
twenty-four hours we obtain the following velocities:</p>

<p class="center">Manchester <span class="top_bottom"><span class="top">300′ 0″ × 12″</span> <span class="bottom">1440</span></span> = 2″·5 per minute.</p>

<p class="center">Leeds <span class="top_bottom"><span class="top">100′ 0″ × 12″</span> <span class="bottom">1440</span></span> = 0″·84 per minute.</p>

<p>Which means that in the Manchester experiments the
velocity would have been three times as large as in Leeds;
and it is clear that if the sewage of both towns was
identical the results, so far as the retention of the
suspended matters in the tanks are concerned, could not
have been identical. As a matter of fact, considerably
greater velocities have been used in the Manchester
experiments, as will be shown later on.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rate of flow through septic tanks should not be expressed by the length of sojourn in tank but by some linear measurement in a stated time.</div>
<p class="pb4">It will be clear from this, that it is most misleading
and erroneous to express the rate of flow by the length of
the sojourn of the sewage in the tank, and that the velocity
should in each case be expressed by some linear measurement
in a stated time&mdash;probably inches per minute.</p>

<p>The next point to consider is the velocity to be
employed in septic tanks; and here it is not without
interest to refer to the various experiments enumerated
with their results in the next table.</p>

<p>The difference in the results obtained, so far as the
suspended matters are concerned, is probably due to the
different character of the various sewages experimented
with; but so low a velocity as 0·52 inch, as used in
the Exeter experiments, does not appear to be necessary.</p>

<p>In the Leeds experiments, it was found that the
filling of the tank once in twenty-four hours gave the best
results; and as the velocity then was 0·84 inch per
<!--095.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 87]</span>
second it will be somewhat near the mark to recommend
generally a velocity of 1 inch per minute. On the
assumption that the sewage shall remain twenty-four
hours in the tank, this gives a length of tank of 120 feet,
which is a very suitable one.</p>

(<span class="subsection">e</span>) <span class="title">Destruction and Liquefaction of Sludge in Septic
Tanks.</span>&mdash;It was formerly maintained that the employment
of a septic tank did away with all sludge
difficulties, and one sees even now advertisements to
that effect, that there is “no sludge” with a septic tank;
but experience everywhere does not bear out this
contention. On the contrary, there must be sludge with
a septic tank, and the only question one has to consider
is, to what extent does a septic tank reduce the quantity
of sludge?</p>

<p>The table above contains the results obtained in the
various experiments, and from these it would appear as
if on an average, with a velocity of 1 inch per minute,
25 per cent. of the total sludge would be destroyed or
<!--096.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 88]</span>

and in the contact beds.</p>

<p>It has already been pointed out that it is claimed
that the septic tank sludge is denser and contains less
moisture than ordinary sludge, and that about half of it
is mineral matter.</p>

disputed, and that is the mixing action going on within
it. The fresh sewage on its arrival becomes mixed with
stale sewage, and, owing to the rising of lumps of sludge
from the bottom, and other causes, the contents of the
tank become of a more uniform composition, which must
entail a corresponding advantage for the subsequent contact
bed treatment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The septic tank effluent is so far as bacterial purity is concerned practically raw sewage.</div>
<p class="pb"><a name="effluent" id="effluent"></a>
(<span class="subsection">h</span>) <span class="title">Micro-organisms in Effluent from Septic Tank.</span>&mdash;Although
the available number of experiments on the
micro-organisms contained in the effluent from a septic
tank is not large, yet they support the conclusion which
one would form by analogous reasoning, that so far as
the bacterial flora is concerned the effluent is practically
raw sewage.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">
<a name="continu" id="continu"></a>4. Continuous Contact Beds.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Continuous contact beds still in an experimental stage.</div>
<p class="pb">It is necessary to make at this point a few short
observations on the artificial self-purification in continuous
contact beds.</p>

<p>This method of artificial purification has frequently
been called “continuous filtration,” but it will be much
better to reserve the term “filtration” for the percolation
of water through fine material, such as sand, and to call
the continuous flow of sewage through coarser material
continuous contact bed treatment, as the processes going
on during the same are more analogous to those going
on in an intermittent contact bed than to those taking
place in a waterworks filter.</p>

<p><!--098.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 90]</span>
Formerly it was attempted to use the same kind of
contact bed for continuous treatment as is used for intermittent
treatment, but, as was to be expected, the results
obtained were so unsatisfactory that the experiments had
to be discontinued. Now somewhat different forms are
utilised, which are mostly protected by patent rights, and
the mode of distribution has also been altered by the
introduction of patent distributors or sprinklers, which
cause the sewage to fall in very thin streams upon the
filling material.</p>

<p>In the Manchester experiments, the proprietary continuous
contact bed does not appear to have given satisfactory
results. Better effluents were obtained at Leeds,
and at York the results obtained are said to have been
very good.</p>

<p>On the whole, however, it is but right to say that the
experience gained so far is not sufficient to entitle us to
form definite opinions, and for this reason it will be better
to await further results.</p>

<abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> MANAGEMENT OF PLANTS FOR THE
ARTIFICIAL SELF-PURIFICATION OF
SEWAGE.</h3>

<div class="p2 sidenote">Plants for the artificial self-purification of sewage require very careful handling.</div>
<p class="pb">It was formerly frequently concluded that neither septic
tank nor contact beds required careful superintendence,
but that they could be worked by automatic machinery
and left to themselves. It was therefore maintained that
the working expenses of plants of this nature would be
next to nil. This was, however, not Mr. Dibdin’s view,
who, after years of careful study, came to the conclusion
that they were delicate pieces of mechanism which
required careful watching.</p>

<p><!--099.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 91]</span>
Since, Mr. Dibdin’s conclusions have been amply
confirmed by all careful experimenters.</p>

<p>For instance, Mr. Fowler, the chemist in charge of
the Manchester experiments, observed before the Royal
Commission on Sewage Disposal as follows: “It is a
delicate operation (the management of septic tank and
contact beds), which requires careful watching! There is
no doubt whatever about that!” (Question 5651.)</p>

<p>Again, the conditions of successful working of contact
beds, laid down by the same gentleman on page 64 of the
Manchester report for the year ending March 27, 1901,
are ample proof of this, and they show very clearly how
extremely careful the supervision of such a plant ought
to be, and that in the hands of inexperienced men it will
soon come to grief.</p>

<p>Professor Percy Frankland stated in his evidence
before the Royal Commission, that in his opinion land
required less skilled supervision than contact beds. (See
Questions 9937, 10071-74.)</p>

<p>A similar view was expressed by Mr. H. M. Wilson,
the chief inspector of the West Riding of Yorkshire
Rivers Board. (Question 6380.)</p>

<abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr>  SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE DEPOSITION
OF SUSPENDED MATTERS
IN TANKS.</h3>

<div class="p2 sidenote">Definition of the term “deposition.”</div>
<p class="pb">The term “deposition” shall here be held to mean
the precipitation of the suspended matters without
chemicals or other artificial means, i.e. the unaided subsidence
of these matters at such a rate of flow that septic
action is not set up within the tanks.</p>

<p>The question that is of interest here, is: Which is
the most favourable rate of flow of the sewage through
<!--100.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 92]</span>
the tank, so far as the deposition of the suspended
matters is concerned? To some extent the answer to
this question will depend on the special characteristics of
the particular sewage under consideration, but for general
purposes the following observations will not be without
interest.</p>

<p>Although of very great importance, this question does
not appear to have received very general consideration, as
the available number of careful experiments is but small.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tank velocity at Barking.</div>
<p>It appears that the calculated velocity in the channels
of the precipitation tanks at Barking is about 4 feet per
minute, and that with this velocity about 77 per cent. of
the suspended matters were deposited in the year 1894.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tank velocity at Manchester.</div>
<p>At the Manchester tanks it is stated that a velocity
of 3 feet 4 inches per minute is employed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Velocity frequently adopted.</div>
<p class="pb">A rate of velocity now frequently adopted in this
country for new works is 6 inches per minute.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Frankfort experiments.</div>
<p>In the settling tanks at Frankfort on the Main there
are deposited about 84 per cent. of the suspended matters,
with velocities ranging from 9½ inches to 16½ inches per
minute.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cassel experiments.</div>
<p>With a velocity of 7 inches per minute, it is stated
that at the Cassel sewage works 97 per cent. of the
suspended matters are retained in the tanks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hanover experiments.</div>
<p>At Hanover a set of interesting observations has
lately been made, on tanks 246 feet long, with a view to
ascertaining the most advantageous rate of flow.</p>

<p>With a velocity of 9·44 inches per minute, 62·7 per
cent. of the suspended organic matters were precipitated,
with a velocity of 14·17 inches per minute 61·7 per cent.
were deposited, and with a velocity of 35·43 inches per
minute 57·3 per cent.; from which figures it will be clear
that there is not much difference in the result on the
suspended matters between these velocities.</p>

<p><!--101.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 93]</span>
Against these results must be placed the results
obtained with septic tanks, where, as has frequently been
stated, a velocity of 1 inch per minute and a sojourn of
twenty-four hours in the tank may be expected to lead
to a deposition of about 60 per cent. of the suspended
matters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reduction of cost.</div>
<p>Where, therefore, a previous septic treatment of the
sewage by anaerobes is not necessary, it is clear that the
substitution of ordinary settling tanks for septic tanks
will be accompanied by a very considerable reduction of
cost.</p>

<h3 class="p4"><a name="conclude" id="conclude"></a>
<abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> CONCLUDING REMARKS.</h3>

<p class="p2">Since the foregoing observations were penned, the
Chairman of the Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal
has delivered a very interesting inaugural address, in
August last, at the Congress in Exeter of the Institute
of Public Health, to which attention ought to be drawn
at this point.</p>

<p>According to <cite>The Times</cite> he is reported to have
stated as follows: “He regretted that he could not give
some idea of the probable date at which the Commission
would issue its final report and recommendations. They
would soon, he hoped, be able to publish the results of a
prolonged investigation into the treatment of sewage on
land; and their experts were now making elaborate
parallel examinations of some of the processes of filtration
by artificial means. But he feared that they would
ultimately be obliged to bring their proceedings to an
arbitrary close; for, however much they could learn, he
was quite certain they could never come to a point at
which they could say there was nothing more to be
learned. The subject was inexhaustible.”</p>

<p><!--102.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 94]</span>
These very guarded observations are almost in direct
contrast with the very positive assurance of some
enthusiastic supporters of artificial treatments, who a
year or two ago did not hesitate in proclaiming throughout
this country that the panacea for all sewage
difficulties had been discovered, and that the investigations
of the Royal Commission were a mere matter of
form and a foregone conclusion.</p>

<p>To all those who did not share these very sanguine
expressions of faith, and who were painfully aware of the
great gaps in our knowledge of the processes taking
place in sewage purification, these words of Lord Iddesleigh
will prove an assurance that the commissioners are
not swayed by popular likes and dislikes, however
fascinating they may be, but that they are earnestly
endeavouring, in an impartial manner, to throw such light
upon this abstruse question as will enable them to
arrive at correct conclusions.</p>

<p>For a like purpose the foregoing remarks have been
written; and if the facts recorded in the previous pages,
and the opinions expressed therein, should prove of
assistance to anyone in forming correct views, the labour
spent on them will be amply repaid.</p>
</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">

<p><!--103.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<h3 class="p4"><a name="postscr" id="postscr"></a>POSTSCRIPT.</h3>

<p class="p2">Since the foregoing remarks were written, I have been
somewhat struck with the views expressed at one or two
meetings by some of those who ought to have the full
facts of the case at their fingers’ ends. There seems to
be a considerable vagueness as to the sanitary results
to be obtained by either the natural or one of the artificial
methods of sewage treatment, and with a view to
making this point quite clear I have prepared the following
comparative statement (see next page), which, I
trust, will show at a glance what one may expect from
either system.</p>

<p>This statement has not been prepared from experimental
installations, where, as a rule, better results are
obtained than in actual every-day work; but it refers to
fairly large works dealing from day to day with the
whole town’s sewage. It has further been assumed,
that the plant both for the natural as well as for the
artificial treatment is suitable, and managed carefully
and on intelligent lines.</p>

<p>As in all sewage treatments the sanitary results have
first to be considered, I have only dealt with them in
the statement, but even if I had extended it to economic
considerations the result would have been practically the
same.</p>

<p>From a careful examination of the facts recorded in
the statement it follows that with natural treatment we
get five distinct advantageous results, against which we
have to place only two on the side of the artificial treatments;
but this means, that if we wish to bring up the
results of these treatments to those obtained by the
natural treatment, we have to supplement them by three
<!--104.png--><span class="pageno">[Pg 96]</span>
further treatments for the extraction of pathogenic germs,
and of the manurial elements, and for the reduction of
the liquid.</p>

<p>It is these facts which ought to be carefully considered
by all those who wish to study the comparative
advantages of these two systems, or who have to decide
on a definite method to be employed in a particular
case, and no step ought to be taken before every one of
these five points has been very carefully weighed. Generally
speaking, that system will be preferred which confers
the greatest number of advantages.</p>

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
